\begin{abstract}
Jupiter's moon Io is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System with hundreds of active volcanoes varying in intensity on different timescales.
Existing photometric observations in the near infrared taken during occultations by Jupiter and Galilean moons encode a wealth of information about its surface.
As such, Io is an ideal testbed for models of time-variable exoplanet surfaces.
We build a single probabilistic model of Io's surface using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization to infer one map per light curve.
The model is built on top of the code Starry \href{https://rodluger.github.io/starry/}{\color{linkcolor}\faGithub} which can compute occultation light curves and phase curves in both emitted and reflected light. It also enables efficient inference with gradient based samplers.
We use the inferred map to study the time variability of prominent volcanoes over a timescale of decades.
While we mostly focus on Io, the lessons we learn are directly applicable to mapping exoplanets.
We discuss this application towards the end of the paper.\href{https://github.com/fbartolic/volcano}{\color{linkcolor}\faGithub}

\section{Introduction}
%% ADD PARAGRAPH REVIEWING PREVIOUS LITERATURE ON MAPPING EXOPLANETS, MENTION JWST AND LUVOIR
%% MAYBE EVEN IN THE ABSTRACT
The surface of Jupiter's moon Io is littered with hundreds of volcanoes appearing as bright spots in the near infrared and varying in intensity on timescales of days to decades.
The volcanic activity is driven by tidal interactions with Jupiter and sustained by the Laplace resonance with Europa and Ganymede \citep{peale_melting_1979}.
Io is a perfect analogue of an extremely volcanically active exoplanet.
Such rocky exoplanets, often dubbed \emph{super-Ios} or \emph{lava worlds}, have gathered a lot of interest in recent years because the photometric and spectral signatures of volcanic activity on such worlds will likely be detectable in the near future \citep{kaltenegger_detecting_2010,henning_highly_2018,oza_sodium_2019}.
Studying volcanism on both Io and exoplanets is scientifically valuable because it provides a window into the properties of early Earth and it informs theories of planet formation.

Existing exoplanet detections with potential volcanism include CoRoT-7b \citep{barnes_corot-7b_2010}, the first discovered rocky exoplanet with likely significant tidal heating; 55 Cancri e, whose longitudinal offset in peak surface emission has been attributed to, among other things, lava flows on the surface \citep{demory_variability_2016,demory_map_2016,hammond_linking_2017}; several planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system in a Laplace-like resonance with likely volcanic activity \citep{kislyakova_magma_2017,dobos_tidal_2019}; and many others.
Not all exoplanets will have Io-like volcanism, some will have magma oceans due to their proximity to the star or volcanism caused by nuclear decay similar to early Earth volcanism.

Io has been observed extensively using both space and ground observatories.
High resolution images of Io's surface were taken by space missions such as Voyager \citep{smith_jupiter_1979}, Galileo \citep{belton_galileos_1996} and Juno \citep{mura_infrared_2020}.
It has also been resolved from the ground in the near infrared using disk resolved imaging
\citep{howell_infrared_1985,simonelli_disk-resolved_1986,spencer_discovery_1990} and adaptive optics observations \citep{marchis_adaptive_2000,marchis_keck_2005,de_kleer_spatial_2016}.
Most importantly for this work, Io has been sporadically observed for decades using high cadence near infrared photometry taken during occultations by Jupiter starting with \cite{spencer_discovery_1990}.
Occultations by Jupiter occur twice every orbit lasting ~1.7 days and mutual occultations with Europa, Ganymede or Callisto happen every ~6 years when Earth pasess through the orbital plane of Galilean satellites.
The majority of occultations by Jupiter are observed when Io is in Jupiter's shadow ("in eclipse") while mutual occultations are almost always observed in sunlight because mutual occultations while Io is in eclipse are extraordinarily rare.
Only the brightest volcanoes are visible over the reflected light background when Io is illuminated by the Sun\citep{veeder_ios_1994,de_kleer_spatial_2016}.

Both kinds of occultations have been used to study volcanic activity on the surface.
\cite{spencer_io_1994} observed several occultations of Io by Europa and detected a major brightening of the most powerful of Io's volcanoes, Loki, relative to previous Voyager observations.
\cite{rathbun_loki_2002, rathbun_loki_2006,rathbun_ground-based_2010} used observations from NASA's IRTF telescope to study the long term variability of different volcanic spots finding evidence of periodicity in Loki's eruptions and established the transient nature of the volcanoes (only Loki is persistently active).
By studying an occultation of Io by Europa, \cite{de_kleer_multi-phase_2017} mapped the Loki region to a precision of about 2 kilometers.
In addition to observations of occultations in near infrared, several groups have been observing mutual occultations in the optical \citep[][and references therein]{arlot_mutual_1974,saquet_phemu15_2018,morgado_astrometry_2016} with the purpose of inferring the optical albedo of Io and improving ephemeris precision for Galilean satellites.

None of the studies of occultations in the infrared attempted to infer a two-dimensional map of Io's surface.
The light curves are usually fit independently with the goal of inferring one-dimensional longitudinal variations in brightness on its surface.
Strong priors on the locations of individual volcanoes are assumed based on maps from space mission observations.
In this work, we build a fully probabilistic model in order to infer a time-dependent two-dimensional \emph{map} of Io's volcanic surface from archival IRTF observations in the near infra red.
The model is built on top of the recently developed code Starry \citep[][Luger et al. 2020 in prep]{luger_starry_2019} which
enables fast analytic computation of occultation light curves and phase curves for objects whose surface features are represented in terms of spherical harmonics.
Starry can compute phase curves and occultations in both emitted light (for modeling the isotropic volcanic emission from Io's surface) and reflected light (for mapping albedo variations).
Instead of fitting one map per occultation light curve, we reduce the dimensionality of the problem using matrix factorization, assuming a fixed map for a given light curve which is a linear combination of $K$ basis maps.
We use priors on the map features which ensure the maps are physical and prevent overfitting of the data.
The model is interpretable, each of the basis maps roughly corresponds to a single spot on the surface, and the coefficients multiplying the basis maps encode information on the time variability.

Our goals for this paper are to both improve on past studies of Io using occultation light curves and to construct a flexible model directly applicable to future efforts on inferring time-dependent maps of variable features on exoplanet surfaces such as volcanoes, magma oceans or clouds.
The fact that we have lots of prior information on what the surface of Io should look like enables us to test our model in a realistic setting, testing sensitivity to chosen priors, data quality, the orbital parameters and different kinds of surface features.

The paper is organized as follows.
In \S\ref{sec:data} we describe the IRTF light curves of occultations by Jupiter which we use to infer maps.
In \S\ref{sec:model} we discuss the generative model for the data for the case of a static map, and a dynamic map modeled using a matrix factorization approach and we write down the relevant likelihood functions.
In \S\ref{sec:inverse_problem} we focus on the question of how to do Bayesian inference given the forward model specifications defined in \S\ref{sec:model}.
We discuss and test different priors on map features, the information content of light curves and fitting the models using variational inference (VI) methods and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC).
We present results on simulated data.
\S\ref{sec:results} shows the results on real data.
In particular, the inferred dynamic map, the  different component maps and accompanying coefficients, the uncertainties of the maps, sensitivity to different choices of priors, comparison of inferred locations and intensities of spots to known values from the literature.
Finally, in \S\ref{sec:exoplanets} we discuss applications of the model to future exoplanet obervations and test the model predictions on simulated JWST observations of a volcanic Super-Earth.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \begin{centering}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/irtf_max_flux.pdf}
    \oscaption{irtf_dataset}{%
        Maximum flux for each curve taken using NASA's IRTF telescope during an
        occultation of Io by Jupiter.
       \label{fig:irtf_max_flux}
    }
    \end{centering}
\end{figure}

The dataset we use to infer maps of Io's surface consists of 112 observations of Io in the near infrared taken from 1996 until 2018 using various instruments at NASA's IRTF observatory.
Figure~\ref{fig:irtf_max_flux} shows the maximum flux in $\mathrm{GW}/\mu \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{sr}$ for each light curve plotted as a function of time which approximately corresponds to the disc integrated flux of Io at the beginning of ingress or the end of egress prior to it being occulted by Jupiter.
Two features of this plot are apparent.
First although the observations span decades the cadence is non-uniform with only a few observations taken between 2008 and 2016.
Second, the baseline brightness is varying stochastically by a large amount and there are several notable events of increased volcanic activity.
All of the observations were taken while Io was \emph{in eclipse}, meaning that it was in Jupiter's shadow and all of the observed emission from the surface is due to thermal radiation.
Observations of Io \emph{in sunlight} on the other hand probe both the thermal (volcanic) emission and the surface albedo variations in the near infrared.


\begin{figure}[h!]
    \begin{centering}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/irtf_sample_lightcurves.pdf}
    \oscaption{irtf_dataset}{%
        A selection of sample light curves taken during occultations of Io by Jupiter in our dataset.
        The step-like morphology of the light curves is due to bright volcanoes on Io's surface coming in or out of view during an occultation.
        These light curves thus visibly encode information about the features on the surface.
        \label{fig:irtf_sample_lightcurves}
    }
    \end{centering}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:irtf_sample_lightcurves} we display a random subset of all the light curves
in the dataset.
All occultations last for $\sim4$ min and the cadence for each light varies but it on the order of a second.
It follows that over the course of a single exposure Jupiter's limb move by about 15km which provides a lower bound for the size of the features on the surface that we can reliably estimate.
The shapes of light curves strongly deviate from the smooth variability one would expect assuming a homogeneous distribution of thermal emission on the surface.
Especially prominent are light curves with clear step-like features which are present when bright spots come in or out of view during the course of an occultation.
The fact that these features are so clearly visible means that even individual light curves encode a wealth of information about the surface.

The photometric quality varies from year to year because multiple instruments were used over the years.
An additional issue is that estimated errorbars aren't provided.
As with all ground based photometry, the observations are influenced by atmospheric variability which induces correlated noise in the light curves.
Because of this the flux isn't always monotonically increasing or decreasing as one would expect.
All of these issues need to be accounted for in the final model.

\subsection{Orbital parameters}
\label{ssec:orbital_parameters}
To model the occultations, first we need to know the trajectory of Jupiter relative to Io for any given time.
To compute the trajectory we use  \href{https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi}{JPL Horizons database} and the latest planetary ephemeris DE430 \citep{folkner_planetary_2014}.
The quantities given by the Horizons database needed to uniquely define the relative trajectory
of Jupiter and the orientation of Io with respect to the observer on Earth are given in Table~\ref{tab:horizons}.
JPL Horizons interface provides $(\alpha,\delta)$ coordinates of both objects and the
central longitude and latitude
