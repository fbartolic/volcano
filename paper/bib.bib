	abstract = {We present measurements of the near-infrared brightness of Io’s hot spots derived from 2 to 5 μm imaging with adaptive optics on the Keck and Gemini N telescopes. The data were obtained on 271 nights between 2013 August and the end of 2018, and include nearly 1000 detections of over 75 unique hot spots. The 100 observations obtained between 2013 and 2015 have been previously published in de Kleer \& de Pater the observations since the start of 2016 are presented here for the ﬁrst time, and the analysis is updated to include the full ﬁve-year data set. These data provide insight into the global properties of Io’s volcanism. Several new hot spots and bright eruptions have been detected, and the preference for bright eruptions to occur on Io’s trailing hemisphere noted in the 2013–2015 data is strengthened by the larger data set and remains unexplained. The program overlapped in time with Sprint-A/EXCEED and Juno observations of the Jovian system, and correlations with transient phenomena seen in other components of the system have the potential to inform our understanding of the impact of Io’s volcanism on Jupiter and its neutral/plasma environment.},

	abstract = {Lambert's model for body reflection is widely used in computer graphics. It is used extensively by rendering techniques such as radiosity and ray tracing. For several real-world objects, however, Lambert's model can prove to be a very inaccurate approximation to the body reflectance. While the brightness of a Lambertian surface is independent of viewing direction, that of a rough surface increases as the viewing direction approaches the light source direction. In this paper, a comprehensive model is developed that predicts body reflectance from rough surfaces. The surface is modeled as a collection of Lambertian facets. It is shown that such a surface is inherently non-Lambertian due to the foreshortening of the surface facets. Further, the model accounts for complex geometric and radiometric phenomena such as masking, shadowing, and interreflections between facets. Several experiments have been conducted on samples of rough diffuse surfaces, such as, plaster, sand, clay, and cloth. All these surface demonstrate significant deviation from Lambertian behavior. The reflectance measurements obtained are in strong agreement with the reflectance predicted by the model.},

While the NIMS instrument could measure thermal emission from hot spots with T{\textgreater}200 K, PPR was the only Galileo instrument capable of mapping the lower temperatures of older, cooling lava flows, and the passive background. We tabulate all data taken by PPR of Io during these flybys and describe some scientific highlights revealed by the data. The data include almost complete coverage of Io at better than 250 km resolution, with extensive regional coverage at higher resolutions. We found a modest poleward drop in nighttime background temperatures and evidence of thermal inertia variations across the surface. Comparison of high spatial resolution temperature measurements with observed daytime SO2 gas pressures on Io provides evidence for local cold trapping of SO2 frost on scales smaller than the 60 km resolution of the PPR data. We also calculated the power output from several hot spots and estimated total global heat flow to be about 2.0–2.6 Wm−2. The low-latitude diurnal temperature variations for the regions between obvious hot spots are well matched by a laterally-inhomogeneous thermal model with less than 1 Wm−2 endogenic heat flow.},

	abstract = {We present a map of Io’s volcanic heat ﬂow. Io’s high heat ﬂow is a result of intense tidal heating, which generates widespread volcanic activity. The surface expression of ongoing volcanic activity constrains the location and magnitude of tidal dissipation within Io. Tidal heating models place heating either at relatively shallow (aesthenosphere) levels, or deep in the mantle. It was thought that actual tidal heating could be approximated using a combination of these end-member models. Io’s volcanic heat ﬂow has now been mapped in sufﬁcient detail to compare with the models. Our maps show that the distribution of heat ﬂow is not matched by current models of deep nor shallow tidal heating, nor by any combination of these two models. We ﬁnd relatively low heat ﬂow at sub-jovian (0°W) and anti-jovian (180°W) longitudes, at odds with the pure aesthenospheric heating model. Furthermore, there are large swaths of Io’s surface where there is poor correlation between the number of hot spots in an area and the power emitted. We have previously accounted for \%54\% of Io’s observed heat ﬂow. We now show that Io’s anomalously warm poles, possibly the result of heat ﬂow from deep-mantle heating, would yield the ‘‘missing” energy (48 TW) if the polar surfaces are at temperatures of \$90 K to \$95 K and cover latitudes above \$43° to \$48° respectively. This possibility implies a ratio of deep to shallow heating of about 1:1. However, explaining regional variations in surface volcanic activity requires more detailed modeling of the location and magnitude of the internal tidal dissipation and the consequences of mantle convection and advection within Io. Future model predictions can be compared to our heat ﬂow map.},

	abstract = {Jupiter’s moon Io is a dynamic target, exhibiting extreme and time-variable volcanic activity powered by tidal forcing from Jupiter. We have conducted a campaign of high-cadence observations of Io with the goal of characterizing its volcanic activity. Between Aug 2013 and the end of 2015, we imaged Io on 100 nights in the near-infrared with adaptive optics on the Keck and Gemini N telescopes, which resolve emission from individual volcanic hot spots. During our program, we made over 400 detections of 48 distinct hot spots, some of which were detected 30+ times. We use these observations to derive a timeline of global volcanic activity on Io, which exhibits wide variability from month to month. The timelines of thermal activity at individual volcanic centers have geophysical implications, and will permit future characterization by others. We evaluate hot spot detection limits and give a simple parameterization of the minimum detectable intensity as a function of emission angle, which can be applied to other analyses. We detected three outburst eruptions in August 2013, but no other outburst-scale events were observed in the subsequent ∼90 observations. Either the cluster of events in August 2013 was a rare occurrence, or there is a mechanism causing large events to occur closely-spaced in time. We also detected large eruptions (though not of outburst scale) within days of one another at Kurdalagon Patera and Sethlaus/Gabija Paterae in 2015. As was also seen in the Galileo dataset, the hot spots we detected can be separated into two categories based on their thermal emission: those that are persistently active for 1 year or more at moderate intensity, and those that are only brieﬂy active, are time-variable, and often reach large intensities. A small number of hot spots in the latter category appear and subside in a matter of days, reaching particularly high intensities; although these are not bright enough to qualify as outbursts, their thermal signatures follow the same pattern, suggesting that a similar mechanism may be responsible for these events though at a smaller scale.},

	abstract = {During the winter of 1991 an unusually favorable series of occultations of Io by Europa took place. We obtained infrared photometry of four of these events at the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope at wavelengths of 5.0 or 3.4 μm, in order to investigate the nature and distribution of volcanism on Io by observing the occultation of the volcanic hot spots by the limb of Europa. Observations at 3.4 μm on 1991/01/08 detected a possible small hot spot in the northern hemisphere. Observations at 5.0 μm on 1991/02/27 detected and resolved the major hot spot Loki, which had a diameter of 170 km and had three times its Voyager 1 flux, and also detected the Voyager hot spot Pele at about half its Voyager 1 flux. A 5.0-μm occultation of Pele on 1991/03/06, when Loki was not occulted, indicated no significant flux change since the week before. Infrared images of Io obtained at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility between October 1990 and April 1991 show that the Europa occultations occurred during a period of unusually high activity at Loki. Loki showed very little thermal emission in observations between 1990/10/12 and 1990/11/27, but increased in flux by a factor of 10 in 32 days by 1991/12/29. Loki then remained bright in all observations until 1991/03/26, but had begun to fade on 1991/04/09. Such rapid variations in flux over such a large area are remarkable. Multiwavelength observations indicate that Loki increased in temperature during the brightening, and that materials hotter than 630 K were exposed at Loki. The possible "Pele-type" volcanoes Surt and Aten, unlike Pele, were not detected, with 3.8 μm flux upper limits of about 8 GW μm-1 str-1.},

	abstract = {Jupiter's moon Io possesses numerous tectonic mountains in addition to its ubiquitous volcanoes and volcanic features. Remarkably, a distinct global anticorrelation exists between the spatial distribution of mountains and volcanic centers on Io. This relationship indicates an explicit connection between volcanism and mountain formation, even though the mountains are tectonic in origin (predominantly upthrusted crustal blocks). Spherical harmonic analysis shows the distribution of mountains and volcanic centers have statistically signiﬁcant power at degree 2; this result is especially striking for the volcanic center distribution, and directly implicates models of asthenospheric tidal heating. The latter predict enhanced heat ﬂux along the equator in a degree-two pattern that matches observations. Mountain formation on Io appears to be a form of dominantly vertical tectonism unique in the modern Solar System: continual burial by widespread volcanism drives the crust inward, which leads to strong compression, and at discrete locations, mountains. Correlation coefﬁcients between the volcanic and mountain distributions indicate statistically meaningful anticorrelation at low spectral degrees (l = 1, 2, 4, and 6); the anticorrelation is especially signiﬁcant between the longitudinal (sectorial) l = 2 components when considered on their own. We compare this anticorrelation with published models that link volcano and mountain formation. While consistent in part with l = 2 convection models, which predict such an anticorrelation (in principle), such low degree anticorrelations are also (if not more) compatible with mountain formation due to, or inﬂuenced by, thermal expansion of Io's crust, and deep compression and thrust faulting in regions of lower than average volcanic heat-piping. Positive correlations between mountain and volcanic center distributions at high spectral degree may reﬂect structural links between a good fraction of mountain blocks and adjacent volcanic paterae, whereas the anticorrelation at low degree implies that most volcanic features (which are far more numerous overall) form independently of mountains.},

	abstract = {The widespread volcanism on the Jovian moon Io is powered by tidal heating, yet we lack a deep understanding of how this distinctive heating process affects the locations, timing, or intensities of Io's eruptions. We show that the quasiperiodic behavior of the volcano Loki Patera in 1987–2018 matches the timescales for the evolution of Io's eccentricity and semimajor axis ({\textasciitilde}480 and {\textasciitilde}460 days). If this orbital forcing is driving Loki Patera's variability, a low‐pass geophysical ﬁlter such as poroelastic ﬂow, or a resonant ampliﬁcation of Io's wobble, could account for the importance of these long‐period orbital variations despite their small amplitudes. The peak volcanic response is predicted to roughly coincide with Io's maximum eccentricity, consistent with the observations. High‐cadence observations over the next several years have the potential to conclusively discriminate between orbital versus geophysical control of Loki Patera's variability. Plain Language Summary Tidal heating is one of the central processes that generates heat in the interiors of planets and moons and is in part responsible for the existence of subsurface oceans and geological activity on moons in the outer solar system. Under this process, the amount of heating that occurs, and the stresses in the crust, vary periodically with the periodic tidal ﬂexing. As a result, we might expect that any geological activity powered by tidal heating, such as volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's tidally heated moon Io, would also vary periodically. Indeed, the water geysers on Saturn's moon Enceladus vary in strength over the course of Enceladus' orbit around Saturn due to tides opening and closing ﬁssures. Io takes only 1.77 days to orbit Jupiter, but its orbit is also slowly changing in time with a period of {\textasciitilde}480 days. We compare the variability of Io's volcanoes with the evolution of its orbit and ﬁnd that the quasiperiodic behavior of Loki Patera, the most powerful volcano on Io, follows a similar pattern as the orbital changes. We explore whether this volcano could be brightening and fading in response to changes in the heating and stresses produced by tides in its interior and what implications this has for the geophysical processes in Io's interior.},

	abstract = {Loki Patera is one of the most dramatically time-variable volcanic features on Io, exhibiting episodic brightening events every 1–3 years that may produce over 15\% of Io’s global heat ﬂow. We observed three such brightening events with adaptive optics imaging at the Keck and Gemini N telescopes over the course of 70 nights of observation in 2013–2016. The high cadence and multi-wavelength nature of the observations provides constraints on models for activity at Loki Patera. The Matson et al. (2006) model for Loki Patera as an overturning basaltic magma sea is adapted to ﬁt the observations of all three events. In particular, we adjust the details of the overturn progression, and modify the lava thermal properties to include dependencies on temperature and porosity, to improve the ﬁt to the data. The preferred models ﬁnd overturn front propagation velocities of 1.2–1.7 km/day, corresponding to resurfacing rates of 1500–2200 m2/s. The time intervals of 440–540 days between successive events are roughly consistent with the 540-day period calculated by Rathbun et al. (2002) for events prior to 2001. The best coverage was obtained for the 2016 brightening; model ﬁts to this event require a lava bulk thermal conductivity of 0.55–0.75 W/m/K, with the best ﬁt obtained for a value of ∼0.7 W/m/K and an average porosity that decreases during cooling. For all three events, the overturn front appears to propagate around the patera in the clockwise direction, opposite to what has been inferred for past brightening events. There is evidence that the overturn may be more complex than a single propagating wave, perhaps involving multiple simultaneous resurfacing waves as well as portions of the patera that are active even after the nominal bright phase has ended. The measured intensities are anomalously low when Loki Patera is viewed at high emission angles, suggestive of topographic shadowing due to a raised area or the edge of the depression in which the magma sea resides.},

The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope observed Io during four Jupiter transit events to obtain medium resolution far-UV spectral images near the Lyα wavelength of 121.6 nm. Jupiter’s bright Lyα dayglow provides a bright, mostly uniform background light source for opacity measurements, much like during a stellar occultation or transiting exoplanet event. Peaks in the photoabsorption cross-sections for sulfur dioxide occur near 122 nm, with resulting absorptions raising the altitude where a tangential line-of-sight opacity of ∼1 occurs. This method of measuring column densities along lines of sight above the limb uses detailed image simulations and complements Lyα reﬂectance imaging and other methods for measuring Io’s SO2 gas on the disk. Our reported near-terminator limb observations with STIS conﬁrm the ﬁndings from previous Lyα disk reﬂectance imaging that Io’s polar SO2 density is an order of magnitude lower than found at the equator. We provide constraints for additional attenuation by atmospheric hydrogen atoms produced by charge exchange reactions between magnetospheric protons and Io’s atmosphere. Searches for plume-related features provided no deﬁnitive enhancements within the signal quality, ruling out unusually high levels of activity for Pele and Tvashtar.},

	abstract = {In February 2007, the New Horizons spacecraft ﬂew by the Jupiter system, obtaining images of Io, the most volcanically active body in the Solar System. The Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC), a four-color (visible to near infrared) camera, obtained 17 sets of images. The Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), a high-resolution panchromatic camera, obtained 190 images, including many of Io eclipsed by Jupiter. We present a complete view of the discrete point-like emission sources in all images obtained by these two instruments. We located 54 emission sources and determined their brightnesses. These observations, the ﬁrst that observed individual Ionian volcanoes on short timescales of seconds to minutes, demonstrate that the volcanoes have stable brightnesses on these timescales. The active volcanoes Tvashtar (63N, 124W) and E. Girru (22N, 245W) were observed by both LORRI and MVIC, both in the near-infrared (NIR) and methane (CH4) ﬁlters. Tvashtar was additionally observed in the red ﬁlter, which allowed us to calculate a color temperature of approximately 1200 K. We found that, with some exceptions, most of the volcanoes frequently active during the Galileo era continued to be active during the New Horizons ﬂyby. We found that none of the seven volcanoes observed by New Horizons multiple times over short timescales showed substantial changes on the order of seconds and only one, E. Girru exhibited substantial variation over minutes to days, increasing by 25\% in just over an hour and decreasing by a factor of 4 over 6 days. Observations of Tvashtar are consistent with a current eruption similar to previously observed eruptions and are more consistent with the thermal emission of a lava ﬂow than the ﬁre fountains inferred from the November 1999 observations. These data also present new puzzles regarding Ionian volcanism. Since there is no associated surface change or low albedo feature that could be identiﬁed nearby, the source of the emission from E. Girru is a mystery. Furthermore, the in-eclipse glows we observe over many paterae are likely to be gas emission from interaction with the magnetosphere, but the details of that process are not clear.},

Because of its strong tidal interaction with Jupiter and the other Galilean satellites, Io is incredibly volcanically active. We use the directly measured volcanic activity level of Io’s volcanoes as a proxy for surface heat ﬂow and compare it to tidal heating model predictions. Volcanic activity is a better proxy for heat ﬂow than simply the locations of volcanic constructs. We determine the volcanic activity level using three data sets: the Galileo Photopolarimeter Radiometer (PPR), Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS), and New Horizons LEISA. We also present a systematic reanalysis of the Galileo NIMS observations to determine the 3.5 μm brightness of 51 active volcanoes. We ﬁnd that potential differences in volcanic style between high and low latitudes make high-latitude observations unreliable for distinguishing between tidal heating models. Observations of Io’s polar areas, such as those by Juno, are necessary to unambiguously understand Io’s heat ﬂow. However, all three of the data sets examined show a relative dearth of volcanic brightness near 180 W (anti-Jovian point) and the equator, and the only data set with good observations of the sub-Jovian point (LEISA) also shows a lack of volcanic brightness in that region. These observations are more consistent with the mantle-heating model than the asthenospheric-heating model. Furthermore, all three of the data sets are consistent with fourfold symmetry in longitude and peak heat ﬂow at mid-latitudes, which best matches with the combined heating case of Tackley et al.},

These measurements provide full longitudinal coverage as well as an eclipse observation and the detection of two outbursts. Reflected sunlight, passive thermal emission, and radiation from thermal anomalies all contribute to the observed flux densities. We find that a new thermophysical model is required to match all the data. Two key elements of this model are (1) a “thermal reservoir” unit which lowers daytime temperatures, and (2) the “thermal pedestal effect” which shifts to shorter wave-lengths the spectral emission due to the reradiation of solar energy absorbed by the thermal anomalies. The thermal anomalies are modeled with a total of 10 source components at five locations. Io's heat flow is the sum of the power from these components.},

Observations at 3.4 μm on 1991/01/08 detected a possible small hot spot in the northern hemisphere. Observations at 5.0 μm on 1991/02/27 detected and resolved the major hot spot Loki, which had a diameter of 170 km and had three times its Voyager 1 flux, and also detected the Voyager hot spot Pele at about half its Voyager 1 flux. A 5.0-μm occultation of Pele on 1991/03/06, when Loki was not occulted, indicated no significant flux change since the week before. Infrared images of Io obtained at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility between October 1990 and April 1991 show that the Europa occultations occurred during a period of unusually high activity at Loki. Loki showed very little thermal emission in observations between 1990/10/12 and 1990/11/27, but increased in flux by a factor of 10 in 32 days by 1991/12/29. Loki then remained bright in all observations until 1991/03/26, but had begun to fade on 1991/04/09. Such rapid variations in flux over such a large area are remarkable. Multiwavelength observations indicate that Loki increased in temperature during the brightening, and that materials hotter than 630 K were exposed at Loki. The possible "Pele-type" volcanoes Surt and Aten, unlike Pele, were not detected, with 3.8 μm flux upper limits of about 8 GW μm-1 str-1.},

They also provide our highest spatial resolution observations of individual volcanic centers such as Loki. We are in the process of reanalyzing observations spanning the years 1985 through 2015 for submission to the NASA Planetary Data System. The Jupiter occultation observations have spatial resolution limited to roughly the Jupiter atmospheric scale height (22 km) but as these events occur every Io orbit we have data on over 100. They include observations from the NASA-IRTF, WIRO, Lowell, and other telescopes on Mauna Kea. Part of this data set originally revealed the semi-periodic nature of the activity at Loki (Rathbun et al. 2002). A series of mutual satellite occultations occurs only every six years but the sharp limb of the other satellite allows for much higher spatial resolution. The original analysis was limited by
inaccuracies in the satellite ephemerides but improvements now allow us to more reliably assign brightnesses to individual hotspots. They also allow improved image reconstructions of individual spots from mutual events. We will report on our tests of that better ephemeris, the improved assignment of hotspot brightnesses, and the reconstructed mutual event images.},

We present the analysis of 35 observations of Amalthea and 19 observations of Thebe realized with the 1-m telescope at the Pic du Midi observatory during three nights in 2015, January and April. The images were reduced through an optimal process that includes image and spherical corrections using the Gaia-DR1 catalogue to provide the most accurate equatorial (RA, Dec.) positions. We compared the observed positions of both satellites with the theoretical positions from JPL JUP310 satellite ephemerides and from the IMCCE INPOP13c planetary ephemeris. The values of rms (O−C) in equatorial positions are ±112 mas for the Amalthea observations, or 330 km at Jupiter, and ±90 mas for the Thebe observations, or 270 km at Jupiter. Using the Gaia-DR1 catalogue allowed us to eliminate systematic errors due to the star references up to 120 mas, or 350 km at Jupiter, by comparison with the UCAC4 catalogue.},

Our intensity distribution model for the eclipsed/occulted satellite is based on the criterion that it simulates a rotational light curve that matches the ground-based light curve. Dichotomy in the scattering characteristics of the leading and trailing sides explains the basic shape of the rotational light curves of Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. In the case of Io, the albedo map (courtesy United States Geological Survey) along with global values of scattering parameters works well. Mean values of residuals in (O − C) along and perpendicular to the track are found to be −3.3 and −3.4 mas, respectively, compared to ‘L2’ theory for the seven 2E1/2O1 events. The corresponding rms values are 8.7 and 7.8 mas, respectively. For the ﬁve 1E3/1O3 events, the along and perpendicular to the track mean residuals are 5.6 and 3.2 mas, respectively. The corresponding rms residuals are 6.8 and 10.5 mas, respectively. We compare the results using the chosen model (Model 1) with a uniform but limb-darkened disc (Model 2). The residuals with Model 2 of the 2E1/2O1 and 1E3/1O3 events indicate a bias along the satellite track. The extent and direction of bias are consistent with the shift of the light centre from the geometric centre. Results using Model 1, which intrinsically takes into account the intensity distribution, show no such bias.},

Apparent distances from mutual phenomena, have much smaller errors, less than 10 mas. However, this method can only be applied during the equinox of the planets. We developed a method that can provide accurate astrometric data for natural satellites – the mutual approximations. The method can be applied when any two satellites pass close by each other in the apparent sky plane. The fundamental parameter is the central instant t0 of the passage when the distances reach a minimum. We applied the method for the Galilean moons. All observations were made with a 0.6 m telescope with a narrow-band ﬁlter centred at 889 nm with width of 15 nm which attenuated Jupiter’s scattered light. We obtained central instants for 14 mutual approximations observed in 2014–2015. We determined t0 with an average precision of 3.42 mas (10.43 km). For comparison, we also applied the method for 5 occultations in the 2009 mutual phenomena campaign and for 22 occultations in the 2014–2015 campaign. The comparisons of t0 determined by our method with the results from mutual phenomena show an agreement by less than 1σ error in t0, typically less than 10 mas.

	abstract = {Future space telescopes will directly image extrasolar planets at visible wavelengths. Time-resolved reﬂected light from an exoplanet encodes information about atmospheric and surface inhomogeneities. Previous research has shown that the light curve of an exoplanet can be inverted to obtain a low-resolution map of the planet, as well as constraints on its spin orientation. Estimating the uncertainty on 2D albedo maps has so far remained elusive. Here, we present exocartographer, a ﬂexible open-source Bayesian framework for solving the exocartography inverse problem. The map is parameterized with equal-area Hierarchical, Equal Area, and isoLatitude Pixelation (HEALPix) pixels. For a ﬁducial map resolution of 192 pixels, a four-parameter Gaussian process describing the spatial scale of albedo variations, and two unknown planetary spin parameters, exocartographer explores a 198-dimensional parameter space. To test the code, we produce a light curve for a cloudless Earth in a face-on orbit with a 90° obliquity. We produce synthetic white-light observations of the planet: ﬁve epochs of observations throughout the planet’s orbit, each consisting of 24 hourly observations with a photometric uncertainty of 1\% (120 data points). We retrieve an albedo map and—for the ﬁrst time—its uncertainties, along with spin constraints. The albedo map is recognizably of Earth, with a typical 90\% uncertainty of 0.14. The retrieved characteristic length scale is ∼9800 km. The obliquity is recovered to be {\textgreater}87°.9 at the 90\% credible level. Despite the uncertainty in the retrieved albedo map, we robustly identify a high-albedo region (the Sahara desert) and a large low-albedo region (the Paciﬁc Ocean).},

	abstract = {Only one exoplanet has so far been mapped in both longitude and 
latitude, but the James Webb Space Telescope should provide
mapping-quality data for dozens of exoplanets. The thermal phase mapping
problem has previously been solved analytically, with orthogonal maps
(spherical harmonics) yielding orthogonal light curves (sinusoids). The
eclipse mapping problem, let alone combined phase+eclipse mapping, does
not lend itself to such a neat solution. Previous efforts have adopted
either spherical harmonics or various ad hoc map parameterizations, none
of which produce orthogonal light curves. We use principal component
analysis to construct orthogonal “eigencurves,” which we
then use to fit published 8 μm observations of the hot Jupiter HD
189733b. This approach has a few advantages over previously used
techniques: (1) the light curves can be precomputed, accelerating the
fitting process, (2) the eigencurves are orthogonal to each other,
reducing parameter correlations, and (3) the eigencurves are
model-independent and are ranked in order of sensitivity. One notable
result of our analysis is that eclipse-only mapping of HD 189733b is far
more sensitive to the central concentration of dayside flux than to the
eastward offset of that hot spot. Mapping can, in principle, suffer from
degeneracies between spatial patterns and orbital parameters. Previous
mapping efforts using these data have either assumed a circular orbit
and precise inclination, or have been pessimistic about the prospects of
eclipse mapping in the face of uncertain orbital parameters. We show

	abstract = {The growing field of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods 
for probabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even
with large data sets. Gaussian processes (GPs) are a popular class of
models used for this purpose, but since the computational cost scales,
in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application
has been limited to small data sets. In this paper, we present a novel
method for GPs modeling in one dimension where the computational
requirements scale linearly with the size of the data set. We
demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical
time series data sets. These demonstrations are examples of
probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic
oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method
exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is
expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly
spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises
naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically driven damped
harmonic oscillators—providing a physical motivation for and
interpretation of this choice—but we also demonstrate that it can
be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a
mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing
scalable GP methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range
of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond.
We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of
this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

We have also applied a pattern recognition algorithm to obtain the minimum number of physical components which can explain the variability of the optical spectrum.

The constructed model is then rescaled with a factor to compensate for the contribution from the disks. We compare NMF with existing methods (classical reference differential imaging method, and the
Karhunen-Loève image projection algorithm) using synthetic
circumstellar disks and demonstrate the superiority of NMF: with no need of prior selection of references, NMF not only can detect fainter circumstellar disks but also better preserves their morphology and does not require forward modeling. As an application to a well-known disk example, we process the archival Hubble Space Telescope STIS
coronagraphic observations of HD 181327 with different methods and compare them, and NMF is able to extract some circumstellar materials inside the primary ring for the first time. In an appendix, we

With existing PSF construction methods, the circumstellar signals (e.g., planets, circumstellar disks) are unavoidably altered by overfitting and/or self-subtraction, making forward modeling a necessity to recover these signals. We present a forward modeling-free solution to these problems with data imputation using sequential nonnegative matrix factorization (DI-sNMF), which first converts this signal separation problem to a "missing data" problem in statistics by flagging the regions that host circumstellar signals as missing data, then attributes PSF signals to these regions. We
mathematically prove it to have negligible alteration to circumstellar signals when the imputation region is relatively small, which thus enables precise measurement of these circumstellar objects. We apply it to simulated point-source and circumstellar disk observations to demonstrate its proper recovery of them. We apply it to Gemini Planet Imager K1-band observations of the debris disk surrounding HR 4796A, finding a tentative trend that the dust is more forward scattering as the wavelength increases. We expect DI-sNMF to be applicable to other general scenarios where the separation of signals is needed.},

	abstract = {A new variant ‘PMF’ of factor analysis is described. It is assumed that X is a matrix of observed data and σ is the known matrix of standard deviations of elements of X. Both X and σ are of dimensions n × m. The method solves the bilinear matrix problem X = GF + E where G is the unknown left hand factor matrix (scores) of dimensions n × p, F is the unknown right hand factor matrix (loadings) of dimensions p × m, and E is the matrix of residuals. The problem is solved in the weighted least squares sense: G and F are determined so that the Frobenius norm of E divided (element-by-element) by σ is minimized. Furthermore, the solution is constrained so that all the elements of G and F are required to be non-negative. It is shown that the solutions by PMF are usually different from any solutions produced by the customary factor analysis (FA, i.e. principal component analysis (PCA) followed by rotations). Usually PMF produces a better fit to the data than FA. Also, the result of PF is guaranteed to be non-negative, while the result of FA often cannot be rotated so that all negative entries would be eliminated. Different possible application areas of the new method are briefly discussed. In environmental data, the error estimates of data can be widely varying and non-negativity is often an essential feature of the underlying models. Thus it is concluded that PMF is better suited than FA or PCA in many environmental applications. Examples of successful applications of PMF are shown in companion papers.},

The present-day lunar orbit is known to submeter accuracy through fitting lunar laser ranging data with an updated lunar gravity field from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission. The orbits of the inner planets are known to subkilometer accuracy through fitting radio tracking measurements of spacecraft in orbit about them. Very long baseline interferometry measurements of spacecraft at Mars allow the orientation of the ephemeris to be tied to the
International Celestial Reference Frame with an accuracy of 0''.0002. This orientation is the limiting error source for the orbits of the terrestrial planets, and corresponds to orbit uncertainties of a few hundred meters. The orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are determined to accuracies of tens of kilometers as a result of fitting spacecraft tracking data. The orbits of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are determined primarily from astrometric observations, for which measurement
uncertainties due to the Earth's atmosphere, combined with star catalog uncertainties, limit position accuracies to several thousand kilometers. DE430 and DE431 differ in their integrated time span and lunar dynamical modeling. The dynamical model for DE430 included a damping term between the Moon's liquid core and solid mantle that gives the best fit to lunar laser ranging data but that is not suitable for backward integration of more than a few centuries. The ephemeris DE431 is similar to DE430 but was fit without the core/mantle damping term, so the lunar orbit is less accurate than in DE430 for times near the current epoch, but is more suitable for times more than a few centuries in the past. DE431 is a longer integration (covering years -13,200 to +17,191) than DE430 (covering years 1550 to 2650).},

Methods: We apply a Maxwell viscoelastic rheology to compute the tidal response of the planets using the volume-weighted average of the viscosities and rigidities of the metal, rock,
high-pressure ice, and liquid water/ice I layers. Results: We show that TRAPPIST-1d and e can avoid entering a runaway greenhouse state. Planet e is the most likely to support a habitable environment, with Earth-like surface temperatures and possibly liquid water oceans. Planet d also avoids a runaway greenhouse, if its surface reflectance is at least as high as that of the Earth. Planets b and c, closer to the star, have heat fluxes high enough to trigger a runaway greenhouse and to support volcanism on the surfaces of their rock layers, rendering them too warm for life. Planets f, g, and h are too far from the star to experience significant tidal heating, and likely have solid ice surfaces with possible subsurface liquid water oceans.},

describe how sodium (Na I) and potassium (K I) gas could be a signature

Analyzing ∼a dozen close-in gas giants hosting robust alkaline
detections, we show that an Io-sized satellite can be stable against
orbital decay below a planetary tidal \{\{ {\textbackslash}mathcal Q \}\}p≲
\{10\}11. This tidal energy is also focused into the satellite
driving an ∼105±2 higher mass-loss rate than
Io’s supply to Jupiter’s Na exosphere based on simple
atmospheric loss estimates. The remarkable consequence is that several
exo-Io column densities are, on average, more than sufficient to provide
the ∼1010±1 Na cm‑2 required by
the equivalent width of exoplanet transmission spectra. Furthermore, the
benchmark observations of both Jupiter’s extended (∼1000 R
J) Na exosphere and Jupiter’s atmosphere in
transmission spectroscopy yield similar Na column densities that are
purely exogenic in nature. As a proof of concept, we fit the
“high-altitude” Na at WASP-49b with an ionization-limited
cloud similar to the observed Na profile about Io. Moving forward, we
strongly encourage time-dependent ingress and egress monitoring along
with spectroscopic searches for other volcanic volatiles.},

However, these past studies failed to take into consideration the role that tides may play in this system. Even if the planet’s eccentricity has always been zero, we show that tidal decay of the semimajor axis could have been large enough that the planet formed on a wider orbit which received less insolation. Moreover, CoRoT-7b could be tidally heated at a rate that dominates its geophysics and drives extreme volcanism. In this case, CoRoT-7b is a “super-Io” that, like Jupiter’s volcanic moon, is dominated by volcanism and rapid resurfacing. Such heating could occur with an eccentricity of just 10−5. This small value could be driven by CoRoT-7c if its own eccentricity is larger than ∼10−4. CoRoT-7b may be the ﬁrst of a class of planetary super-Ios likely to be revealed by the CoRoT and Kepler spacecraft.},

	abstract = {CoRoT-7b, a planet about 70\% larger than the Earth orbiting a Sun-like star, is the first-discovered rocky exoplanet, and hence has been dubbed a “super-Earth.” Some initial studies suggested that since the planet is so close to its host star, it receives enough insolation to partially melt its surface. However, these past studies failed to take into consideration the role that tides may play in this system. Even if the planet's eccentricity has always been zero, we show that tidal decay of the semimajor axis could have been large enough that the planet formed on a wider orbit which received less insolation. Moreover, CoRoT-7b could be tidally heated at a rate that dominates its geophysics and drives extreme volcanism. In this case, CoRoT-7b is a “super-Io” that, like Jupiter's volcanic moon, is dominated by volcanism and rapid resurfacing. Such heating could occur with an eccentricity of just 10–5. This small value could be driven by CoRoT-7c if its own eccentricity is larger than ∼10–4. CoRoT-7b may be the first of a class of planetary super-Ios likely to be revealed by the CoRoT and Kepler spacecraft.},

	abstract = {Geological activity is thought to be important for the origin of life and for maintaining planetary habitability. We show that transient sulfate aerosols could be a signature of exoplanet volcanism and therefore of a geologically active world. A detection of transient aerosols, if linked to volcanism, could thus aid in habitability evaluations of the exoplanet. On Earth, subduction-induced explosive eruptions inject SO2 directly into the stratosphere, leading to the formation of sulfate aerosols with lifetimes of months to years. We demonstrate that the rapid increase and gradual decrease in sulfate aerosol loading associated with these eruptions may be detectable in transit transmission spectra with future large-aperture telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), for a planetary system at a distance of 10 pc, assuming an Earth-like atmosphere, bulk composition, and size. Specifically, we find that a signal-to-noise ratio of 12.1 and 7.1 could be achieved with E-ELT (assuming photon-limited noise) for an Earth analogue orbiting a Sun-like star and M5V star, respectively, even without multiple transits binned together. We propose that the detection of this transient signal would strongly suggest an exoplanet volcanic eruption, if potential false positives such as dust storms or bolide impacts can be ruled out. Furthermore, because scenarios exist in which O2 can form abiotically in the absence of volcanic activity, a detection of transient aerosols that can be linked to volcanism, along with a detection of O2, would be a more robust biosignature than O2 alone.

We calculate the observation time needed to detect explosive volcanism on exoplanets in primary as well as secondary eclipse and discuss the likelihood of observing volcanism on transiting Earth-sized to super-Earth-sized exoplanets. We find that sulfur dioxide from large explosive eruptions does present a spectral signal that is remotely detectable especially for secondary eclipse measurements around the closest stars and ground-based telescopes, and report the frequency and magnitude of the expected signatures. The transit probability of a planet in the habitable zone decreases with distance from the host star, making small, nearby host stars the best targets.},

We focus on the planets in TRAPPIST-1, whose orbital planes we show are aligned to {\textless}0. 3 at 90\% conﬁdence. We present a photodynamical model for predicting and computing PPOs in TRAPPIST-1 and other systems for various assumptions of the planets’ atmospheric states. When marginalizing over the uncertainties on all orbital parameters, we ﬁnd that the rate of PPOs in TRAPPIST-1 is about 1.4 per day. We investigate the prospects for detection of these events with the James Webb Space Telescope, ﬁnding that ∼10–20 occultations per year of b and c should be above the noise level at 12–15μm. Joint modeling of several of these PPOs could lead to a robust detection. Alternatively, observations with the proposed Origins Space Telescope should be able to detect individual PPOs at high signal-to-noise ratios. We show how PPOs can be used to break transit timing variation degeneracies, imposing strong constraints on the eccentricities and masses of the planets, as well as to constrain the longitudes of nodes and thus the complete three-dimensional structure of the system. We further show how modeling of these events can be used to reveal a planet’s day/night temperature contrast and construct crude surface maps.

	abstract = {Highly volcanic exoplanets, which can be variously characterized as 'lava worlds', 'magma ocean worlds', or 'super-Ios' are high priority targets for investigation. The term 'lava world' may refer to any planet with extensive surface lava lakes, while the term 'magma ocean world' refers to planets with global or hemispherical magma oceans at their surface. 'Highly volcanic planets', including super-Ios, may simply have large, or large numbers of, active explosive or extrusive volcanoes of any form. They are plausibly highly diverse, with magmatic processes across a wide range of compositions, temperatures, activity rates, volcanic eruption styles, and background gravitational force magnitudes. Worlds in all these classes are likely to be the most characterizable rocky exoplanets in the near future due to observational advantages that stem from their preferential occurrence in short orbital periods and their bright day-side flux in the infrared. Transit techniques should enable a level of characterization of these worlds analogous to hot Jupiters. Understanding processes on highly volcanic worlds is critical to interpret imminent observations. The physical states of these worlds are likely to inform not just geodynamic processes, but also planet formation, and phenomena crucial to habitability. Volcanic and magmatic activity uniquely allows chemical investigation of otherwise spectroscopically inaccessible interior compositions. These worlds will be vital to assess the degree to which planetary interior element abundances compare to their stellar hosts, and may also offer pathways to study both the very young Earth, and the very early form of many silicate planets where magma oceans and surface lava lakes are expected to be more prevalent. We suggest that highly volcanic worlds may become second only to habitable worlds in terms of both scientific and public long-term interest.},

The phase curve has a high amplitude and peak offset, suggesting that it has a signiﬁcant eastward hot-spot shift as well as a large day–night temperature contrast. We use a general circulation model to model potential climates, and investigate the relation between bulk atmospheric composition and the magnitude of these seemingly contradictory features. We conﬁrm theoretical models of tidally locked circulation are consistent with our numerical model of 55 Cnc e, and rule out certain atmospheric compositions based on their thermodynamic properties. Our best-ﬁtting atmosphere has a signiﬁcant hot-spot shift and day–night contrast, although these are not as large as the observed phase curve. We discuss possible physical processes that could explain the observations, and show that night-side cloud formation from species such as SiO from a day-side magma ocean could potentially increase the phase curve amplitude and explain the observations. We conclude that the observations could be explained by an optically thick atmosphere with a low mean molecular weight, a surface pressure of several bars, and a strong eastward circulation, with nightside cloud formation a possible explanation for the difference between our model and the observations.},

need accurate positions spread over extended periods. We present the
results of the 2014-2015 Brazilian campaign for 40 mutual events from 47
observed light curves by the Galilean satellites plus one eclipse of
Amalthea by Ganymede. We also reanalysed and updated results for 25
mutual events observed in the 2009 campaign.

All telescopes were equipped with narrow-band filters centred at 889 nm
with a width of 15 nm to eliminate the scattered light from Jupiter. The
albedos' ratio was determined using images before and after each event.
We simulated images of moons, umbra, and penumbra in the sky plane, and
integrated their fluxes to compute albedos, simulate light curves and
fit them to the observed ones using a chi-square fitting procedure. For
that, we used the complete version of the Oren-Nayer reflectance model.
The relative satellite positions mean uncertainty was 11.2 mas ( 35 km)
and 10.1 mas ( 31 km) for the 2014-2015 and 2009 campaigns
respectively. The simulated and observed ASCII light curve files are
freely available in electronic form at the Natural Satellites DataBase
(NSDB).

The 40/25 mutual events from our 2014-2015/2009 campaigns represent a
significant contribution of 17\%/15\% in comparison with the PHEMU
campaigns lead by the IMCCE. Besides that, our result for the eclipse of
Amalthea is only the 4th such measurement ever published
after the three ones observed by the 2014-2015 international PHEMU
campaign. Our results are suitable for new orbital/ephemeris

Éphémérides (IMCCE), Paris, France, and the
Sternberg Astronomical Institute (SAI), Moscow, Russia, led an
international observation campaign to record ground-based photometric
observations of Galilean moon mutual occultations and eclipses. We
focused on processing the complete photometric observations data base to
compute new accurate astrometric positions. We used our method to derive
astrometric positions from the light curves of the events. We developed
an accurate photometric model of mutual occultations and eclipses, while
correcting for the satellite albedos, Hapke's light scattering law, the
phase effect, and the limb darkening. We processed 609 light curves, and
we compared the observed positions of the satellites with the
theoretical positions from IMCCE NOE-5-2010-GAL satellite ephemerides
and INPOP13c planetary ephemeris. The standard deviation after fitting
the light curve in equatorial positions is ±24 mas, or 75 km at
Jupiter. The rms (O-C) in equatorial positions is ±50 mas, or 150
km at Jupiter.},

	abstract = {We present adaptive optics (AO) observations of Io taken with the W.M. Keck II telescope on 18 December 2001 (UT) before the satellite went into eclipse, and while it was in Jupiter's shadow. Making these kind of Io-in-eclipse observations, as well as the associated data reduction and analysis are challenging; hence one focus of the paper is to explain the methods and tools used for these data sets. For the sunlit images Io itself was used as the wavefront reference source, while nearby Ganymede was used as reference 'star' when Io was in eclipse. Observations were obtained in K'-, L'-, and M-bands. The sunlit images have been
deconvolved using MISTRAL. The Io-in-eclipse data were deconvolved with IDAC and MISTRAL. The former gives better results, both in absolute photometry and in matching the original images. We determined the flux densities of the hot spots from the original Io-in-eclipse data with StarFinder, as well as from the deconvolved images by integrating the intensity over the relevant areas. We determined the highly
anisoplanatic PSF via a FFT method from the original data, and used this in StarFinder and as a starting PSF for IDAC and MISTRAL. We derived temperatures and areal coverage of all 19 spots detected in both K'- and L'-band images of Io-in-eclipse. We also determined temperatures and areal coverage of the hot spots visible on the L'- and M-band images of sunlit Io. Most volcanoes contain a compact hot 'core' (≲10 km
2 at 600-800 K) within a larger area at lower temperatures (e.g., ∼10 2-10 4 km 2 at 300-500 K). The total heat flow contributed by these active volcanoes is 0.2 W m -2, ∼8\% of the average global heat flow measured at 5-20 μm by Veeder et al. [J. Geophys. Res. 99 (1994) 17095].},

Adding these data to those published by Rathbun and Spencer (2006) and the Gemini data of de Kleer and de Pater (2016a, 2017) results in a database of 3.5–3.8 μm emission from Loki Patera over almost 3 decades. Data presented here contain adaptive optics (AO) observations of Io’s sunlit hemisphere at wavelengths between 1.6 and 5 μm, AO observations of Io in eclipse at 2–5 μm, and non-AO observations of Io in eclipse at 1.6–12 μm. The non-AO data were taken in September of 1999, during the early phase of a brightening event that was documented by Howell et al. (2001). Dual-component Io Flow model (IFM) ﬁts to our 1999 observations show a mostly cool lava crust over almost the entire patera ﬂoor, with a relatively small hotter component making up less than 1\% of the total area, consistent with previous observations. The 30-year timeline of Loki Patera revealed that, after an apparent cessation of, or change in, brightening events in 2002, Loki Patera became active again in 2009. The more recent activity may have a slightly shorter periodicity than observed by Rathbun et al. (2002), and the direction of ﬂow propagation appears to have reversed. Since 2009 the ﬂow direction is in the clockwise direction, starting in the north or north-east corner and propagating along the patera towards the south-west. During the Galileo era the propagation was in the counter-clockwise direction, starting in the south-west and propagating towards the east. Both the 30-year timeline and the 1.6–12 μm spectrum that was obtained during the brightening event in 1999 agree well with Matson et al.’s (2006) overturning lava lake model, as modiﬁed by de Kleer and de Pater (2017).},

These observations, performed at thermal wavelengths when Io is in daylight, have been carefully processed to improve the sharpness of the initial, diffraction-limited, images. The myopic deconvolution process used ( idac) achieved an angular resolution estimated to be 0.15 arcsec, corresponding to a spatial resolution of ∼570 km on Io's disc at the time of the observations. The final
images show a number of bright features which have been compared with the Galileo/NIMS data, the only data set with a comparable resolution available for the anti-Jovian side of the satellite as well as its Jupiter-facing side. Our maps of the hot spot distribution are quite consistent with the Galileo data. The Jupiter-facing side is dominated by emission from Loki, which accounts for ∼25\% of the total hot spot emission from that side (and 45\% of that we were able to resolve and identify), although Loki was in a phase of decreasing activity (but not yet quiescent), as derived from ground-based monitoring observations. A few more hot sources are detected, including Pele-Pillan. The other hemisphere is characterized by a large number of moderately bright hot spots which are distributed around Bosphorus Regio. These preliminary observations fully demonstrate the capabilities of an AO system coupled with a thermal camera to monitor the volcanic activity of Io, in terms of morphology as well as thermal output. These monitoring capabilities will become especially important when the Galileo mission ends.},

Near Infrared System, ADONIS) at 3.8 μm from 1996 to 1999, with
particular emphasis on the observations carried out in late 1999 in
support of the Galileo flybys of Io. Use of a new myopic deconvolution
method, Myopic Iterative Step Preserving Algorithm (MISTRAL), especially
designed for planetary objects, significantly improves the quality and
the reliability of the reconstructed images. Using a simulation of
artificial images of Io, we estimate the extent to which this algorithm
is able to prevent noise amplification, to better restore sharp edges,
and to preserve the initial photometry. Once this algorithm has been
applied to our data and the solar-reflected background has been
subtracted, we have 89 images of Io available for search and temporal
survey of the hot spots over 4 years. In most cases, the data, acquired
during two consecutive nights, provide an almost global view of the
surface of Io. We identify 20 hot spots for which we determine the
coordinates and the brightness at 3.8 μm (as a function of time).
More than half of the hot spots were detected on all the images and were
considered as persistent. Particular emphasis has been put on the
brightest two hot spots, Loki and Pele, for which we obtain a
center-to-limb variation curve (a cosine curve for Loki and a curve
decreasing slightly faster than a cosine law for Pele with possible
physical interpretations). The temporal variations of their activity
have been derived over these 4 years and, for Loki, compared with the
results of other ground-based surveys. The variability of the other,
fainter, sources has also been derived but with less accuracy. We have
also identified a few new hot spots, some of which are transient, such
as a diffuse emission seen in September and November 1999 at the
location of the upcoming Tvashtar outburst. The data are based on
observations (58.F-1003, 63.S-0260, and 64.S-0661) collected at the
European Southern Observatory in La Silla, Chile.},

Here we present JIRAM’s first images and spectra of Io. These observations are used to characterize the location and possible morphology, and some temperatures, of Io’s volcanic thermal sources; the identification of SO2 and the possible identification of other materials. A new hot spot/volcano is identified close to the South Pole of Io, and others are seen in lower latitude regions, which were previously unmapped. Images of the same region taken 2 months apart also show variations of hot spot intensity, possibly due to new lava flows or to lava flow breakouts.},

Changes in surface color and plume distribution indicate differences in resurfacing processes near hot spots on Io. Patchy emissions were seen while Io was in eclipse by Jupiter. The outer margins of prominent linear markings (triple bands) on Europa are diffuse, suggesting that material has been vented from fractures. Numerous small circular craters indicate
localized areas of relatively old surface. Pervasive brittle deformation of an ice layer appears to have formed grooves on Ganymede. Dark terrain unexpectedly shows distinctive albedo variations to the limit of resolution.},

The record of Large Igneous Provinces in Earth and other planetary objects suggest the existence of increasing, decreasing and cessation phases of major volcanic activity over geological time scales. We have extended the existing scale of measuring intensity of volcanic eruptions based on Earth based observations to accommodate intense and extreme volcanic activity. The mass of a rocky planetary object is found to be related to the magnitude of the internal heat, occurrences of Large Igneous Provinces and the duration of major volcanic activity from relevant data available for the inner solar system. The internal heat magnitude may also decide the intensity of volcanism in these planetary objects. The time evolution of volcanism in Earth and Mars has probably influenced the origin of life and biological evolution in these planets.},

Unlike alternative approaches for joint solvers of multiple-constraint problems, we do not require linear operators L of a constraint function gðL ÁÞ to be invertible or linked between each other. bSDMM is well-suited for a range of optimization problems, in particular for data analysis, where f is the likelihood function of a model and L could be a transformation matrix describing e.g. ﬁnite differences or basis transforms. We apply bSDMM to the Non-negative Matrix Factorization task of a hyperspectral unmixing problem and demonstrate convergence and effectiveness of multiple constraints on both matrix factors.

	abstract = {We present the source separation framework SCARLET for multi-band images, which is based on a generalization of the Non-negative Matrix Factorization to alternative and several simultaneous constraints. Our approach describes the observed scene as a mixture of components with compact spatial support and uniform spectra over their support. We present the algorithm to perform the matrix factorization and introduce constraints that are useful for optical images of stars and distinct stellar populations in galaxies, in particular symmetry and monotonicity with respect to the source peak position. We also derive the treatment of correlated noise and convolutions with band-dependent point spread functions, rendering our approach applicable to coadded images observed under variable seeing conditions. SCARLET thus yields a PSF-matched photometry measurement with an optimally chosen weight function given by the mean morphology in all available bands. We demonstrate the performance of SCARLET for deblending crowded extragalactic scenes and on an AGN jet -- host galaxy separation problem in deep 5-band imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Stategic Survey Program. Using simulations with prominent crowding we show that SCARLET yields superior results to the HSC-SDSS deblender for the recovery of total fluxes, colors, and morphologies. Due to its non-parametric nature, a conceptual limitation of SCARLET is its sensitivity to undetected sources or multiple stellar population within detected sources, but an iterative strategy that adds components at the location of significant residuals appears promising.

	abstract = {This article presents theoretical and experimental results about constrained non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in a Bayesian framework. A model of superimposed Gaussian components including harmonicity is proposed, while temporal continuity is enforced through an inverse-Gamma Markov chain prior. We then exhibit a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm to estimate the parameters. Computational time is reduced by initializing the system with an original variant of multiplicative harmonic NMF, which is described as well. The algorithm is then applied to perform polyphonic piano music transcription. It is compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, especially NMF-based. Convergence issues are also discussed on a theoretical and experimental point of view.},

	abstract = {The characterization of geologic heterogeneity that affects flow and transport phenomena in the subsurface is essential for cost-effective and reliable decision-making in applications such as groundwater supply and contaminant cleanup. In the last decades, geostatistical inversion approaches have been widely used to tackle subsurface characterization problems and quantify their corresponding uncertainty. Some well-established geostatistical methods use models that assume gradually varying parameters. However, in many cases, the subsurface can often be better represented as consisting of a few relatively uniform geologic facies or zones with abrupt changes at their boundaries. We advance a Bayesian inversion approach with the gradient represented not through a Gaussian but a Laplace prior, also known as total variation prior, for the case that there are reasons to believe that discrete geologic structures with relatively homogeneous properties predominate in the subsurface but their number, locations, and shapes are unknown a priori. Structural parameters (or hyperparameters of the inversion scheme) are determined in a Bayesian framework by maximizing the marginal distribution of these parameters using an expectation-maximization approach; this allows proper weighting of prior versus data information and produces results with realistic uncertainty quantification. We present here three applications of the method: a time-varying extraction rate estimation at a well, a linear cross-well seismic tomography, and a nonlinear hydraulic tomography. These results are compared with those achieved in the classical geostatistical method and it is shown that the Bayesian inversion approach with total variation prior can be a useful tool to identify discrete geologic structures.},

	abstract = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a workhorse for signal and data analytics, triggered by its model parsimony and interpretability. Perhaps a bit surprisingly, the understanding to its model identifiability---the major reason behind the interpretability in many applications such as topic mining and hyperspectral imaging---had been rather limited until recent years. Beginning from the 2010s, the identifiability research of NMF has progressed considerably: Many interesting and important results have been discovered by the signal processing (SP) and machine learning (ML) communities. NMF identifiability has a great impact on many aspects in practice, such as ill-posed formulation avoidance and performance-guaranteed algorithm design. On the other hand, there is no tutorial paper that introduces NMF from an identifiability viewpoint. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by offering a comprehensive and deep tutorial on model identifiability of NMF as well as the connections to algorithms and applications. This tutorial will help researchers and graduate students grasp the essence and insights of NMF, thereby avoiding typical `pitfalls' that are often times due to unidentifiable NMF formulations. This paper will also help practitioners pick/design suitable factorization tools for their own problems.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10094},
	abstract = {The Proximal Gradient Method (PGM) is a robust and efficient way to minimize the sum of a smooth convex function \$f\$ and a non-differentiable convex function \$r\$. It determines the sizes of gradient steps according to the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of \$f\$. For many problems in data analysis, the Lipschitz constants are expensive or impossible to compute analytically because they depend on details of the experimental setup and the noise properties of the data. Adaptive optimization methods like AdaGrad choose step sizes according to on-the-fly estimates of the Hessian of \$f\$. As quasi-Newton methods, they generally outperform first-order gradient methods like PGM and adjust step sizes iteratively and with low computational cost. We propose an iterative proximal quasi-Newton algorithm, AdaProx, that utilizes the adaptive schemes of Adam and its variants (AMSGrad, AdamX, PAdam) and works for arbitrary proxable penalty functions \$r\$. In test cases for Constrained Matrix Factorization we demonstrate the advantages of AdaProx in fidelity and performance over PGM, especially when factorization components are poorly balanced.

	abstract = {Based on observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Subaru Telescope, we have discovered that Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are bright around 1.5 μm even when not directly lit by sunlight. The observations were conducted with non-sidereal tracking on Jupiter outside of the ﬁeld of view to reduce the stray light subtraction uncertainty due to the close proximity of Jupiter. Their eclipsed luminosity was 10−6–10−7 of their uneclipsed brightness, which is low enough that this phenomenon has been undiscovered until now. In addition, Europa in eclipse was {\textless}1/10 of the others at 1.5 μm, a potential clue to the origin of the source of luminosity. Likewise, Ganymede observations were attempted at 3.6 μm by the Spitzer Space Telescope, but it was not detected, suggesting a signiﬁcant wavelength dependence. It is still unknown why they are luminous even when in the Jovian shadow, but forward-scattered sunlight by hazes in the Jovian upper atmosphere is proposed as the most plausible candidate. If this is the case, observations of these Galilean satellites while eclipsed by the Jovian shadow provide us with a new technique to investigate the Jovian atmospheric composition. Investigating the transmission spectrum of Jupiter by this method is important for investigating the atmosphere of extrasolar giant planets by transit spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {We present in this Keck AO paper the ﬁrst global high angular resolution observations of Io in three broadband near-infrared ﬁlters: Kc (2.3 µm), Lp (3.8 µm), and Ms (4.7 µm). The Keck AO observations are composed of 13 data sets taken during short time intervals spanning 10 nights in December, 2001. The MISTRAL deconvolution process, which is speciﬁcally aimed for planetary images, was applied to each image. The spatial resolution achieved with those ground-based observations is 150, 240, and 300 km in the Kc, Lp, and Ms band, respectively, making them similar in quality to most of the distant observations of the Galileo/NIMS instrument. Eleven images per ﬁlter were selected and stitched together after being deprojected to build a cylindrical map of the entire surface of the satellite. In Kc-band, surface albedo features, such as paterae (R {\textgreater} 60 km) are easily identiﬁable. The Babbar region is characterized by extremely low albedo at 2.2 µm, and shows an absorption band at 0.9 µm in Galileo/SSI data. These suggest that this region is covered by dark silicate deposits, possibly made of orthopyroxene. In the Lp–Ms (3–5 µm) bands, the thermal emission from active centers is easily identiﬁed. We detected 26 hot spots in both broadband ﬁlters over the entire surface of the minor planet; two have never been seen active before, nine more are seen in the Ms band. We focused our study on the hot spots detected in both broadband ﬁlters. Using the measurements of their brightness, we derived the temperature and area covered by 100 brightness measurements. Loki displayed a relatively quiescent activity. Dazhbog, a new eruption detected by Galileo/NIMS in August 2001, is a major feature in our survey. We also point out the fading of Tvashtar volcanic activity after more than two years of energetic activity, and the presence of a hot, but small, active center at the location of Surt, possibly a remnant of its exceptional eruption detected in February 2001. Two new active centers, labeled F and V on our data, are detected. Using the best temperature and the surface area derived from the L and M band intensities, we calculated the thermal output of each active center. The most energetic hot spots are Loki and Dazhbog, representing respectively 36 and 19\% of the total output calculated from a temperature ﬁt of all hot spots (20.6 × 1012 W). Based on the temperature derived from hot spots (∼400 K), our measurement can unambiguously identify the contribution to the heat ﬂux from the silicate portion of the surface. Because the entire surface was observed, no extrapolation was required to calculate that ﬂux. It is also important to note that we measured the brightness of the individual hot spots when they were located close to the Central Meridian. This minimizes the line-of-sight effect which does not follow strictly a classical cosine law. Finally, we argue that despite the widespread volcanic activity detected, Io was relatively quiescent in December 2001, with a minimum mean total output of 0.4–1.2 W m−2. This output is at least a factor of two lower than those inferred from observations made at longer wavelengths and at different epochs.},

Its atmosphere may be water-rich and have a large scale-height, though attempts to characterize it have yielded ambiguous results. Here we present a sensitive search for water and TiO in its atmosphere at high spectral resolution using the Gemini North telescope and the GRACES spectrograph. We combine observations with previous observations from Subaru and CFHT, improving the constraints on the presence of water vapor. We adopt parametric models with an updated planet radius based on recent measurements, and use a cross-correlation technique to maximize sensitivity. Our results are consistent with atmospheres that are cloudy or contain minimal amounts of water and TiO. Using these parametric models, we rule out a water-rich atmosphere (VMR {\textgreater}= 0.1\%) with a mean molecular weight of {\textless}= 15 g/mol at a 3 sigma confidence level, improving on the previous limit by a significant margin. For TiO, we rule out a mean molecular weight of {\textless}= 5 g/mol with a 3 sigma confidence level for a VMR greater than 10{\textasciicircum}-8; for a VMR of greater than 10{\textasciicircum}-7, the limit rises to a mean molecular weight of {\textless}= 10 g/mol. We can rule out low mean-molecular-weight chemical equilibrium models both including and excluding TiO/VO at very high confidence levels ({\textgreater} 10 sigma). Overall, our results are consistent with an atmosphere with a high mean molecular weight and/or clouds, or no atmosphere.},

Unfortunately, the great distance to even the closest exoplanets makes it impossible to resolve their disk with current or near-term technology. It is still possible, however, to deduce spatial inhomogeneities in exoplanets provided that different regions are visible at different times - this can be due to rotation, orbital motion, and occultations by a star, planet, or moon. Astronomers have so far constructed maps of thermal emission and albedo for short-period giant planets. These maps constrain atmospheric dynamics and cloud patterns in exotic atmospheres.

	abstract = {Recent observations of the potentially habitable planets TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g suggest that they possess large water mass fractions of possibly several tens of wt\% of water, even though the host star's activity should drive rapid atmospheric escape. These processes can photolyze water, generating free oxygen and possibly desiccating the planet. After the planets formed, their mantles were likely completely molten with volatiles dissolving and exsolving from the melt. In order to understand these planets and prepare for future observations, the magma ocean phase of these worlds must be understood. To simulate these planets, we have combined existing models of stellar evolution, atmospheric escape, tidal heating, radiogenic heating, magma ocean cooling, planetary radiation, and water-oxygen-iron geochemistry. We present magmoc, a versatile magma ocean evolution model, validated against the rocky Super-Earth GJ 1132b and early Earth. We simulate the coupled magma ocean-atmospheric evolution of TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g for a range of tidal and radiogenic heating rates, as well as initial water contents between 1 and 100 Earth-oceans. We find that TRAPPIST-1 f and g most likely followed the extremely wet scenario with a prolonged magma ocean phase of at least 250 Myr. Planet e probably followed the dry or intermediate track, and may or may not have possessed little water vapour or oxygen in the atmosphere at the time of mantle solidification. For all planets that we investigated, we find that only 3-5\% of the initial water will be locked in the mantle after the magma ocean solidified.},

	title = {{ALMA} {Observations} of {Io} {Going} into and {Coming} out of {Eclipse}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07729},
	abstract = {We present 1-mm observations constructed from ALMA [Atacama Large (sub)Millimeter Array] data of SO\$\_2\$, SO and KCl when Io went from sunlight into eclipse (20 March 2018), and vice versa (2 and 11 September 2018). There is clear evidence of volcanic plumes on 20 March and 2 September. The plumes distort the line profiles, causing high-velocity (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$500 m/s) wings, and red/blue-shifted shoulders in the line profiles. During eclipse ingress, the SO\$\_2\$ flux density dropped exponentially, and the atmosphere reformed in a linear fashion when re-emerging in sunlight, with a "post-eclipse brightening" after \${\textbackslash}sim\$10 minutes. While both the in-eclipse decrease and in-sunlight increase in SO was more gradual than for SO\$\_2\$, the fact that SO decreased at all is evidence that self-reactions at the surface are important and fast, and that in-sunlight photolysis of SO\$\_2\$ is the dominant source of SO. Disk-integrated SO\$\_2\$ in-sunlight flux densities are \${\textbackslash}sim\$2--3 times higher than in-eclipse, indicative of a roughly 30--50{\textbackslash}\% contribution from volcanic sources to the atmosphere. Typical column densities and temperatures are \$N {\textbackslash}approx (1.5 {\textbackslash}pm 0.3) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{16\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ and \$T {\textbackslash}approx 220-320\$ K both in-sunlight and in-eclipse, while the fractional coverage of the gas is 2--3 times lower in-eclipse than in-sunlight. The low level SO\$\_2\$ emissions present during eclipse may be sourced by stealth volcanism or be evidence of a layer of non-condensible gases preventing complete collapse of the SO\$\_2\$ atmosphere. The melt in magma chambers at different volcanoes must differ in composition to explain the absence of SO and SO\$\_2\$, but simultaneous presence of KCl over Ulgen Patera.},

	abstract = {A convolution of the all-sky survey data with a smoothing function is crucial in calculating the smooth surface brightness of the sky survey data. The convolution is usually performed using a spherical version of the convolution theorem. However, a Gaussian function, applicable only in the flat-sky approximation, has been usually adopted as a smoothing kernel. In this paper, we present an exact analytic solution of the spherical-harmonics transformation of a Fisher-von Mises function, the mathematical version of a Gaussian function in spherical space. We also obtain the approximate solutions exp[-l(l + 1)/2k]. The exact and the approximate solutions may be useful when an astrophysical survey map is convolved with a smoothing function of k{\textgreater}1.},
