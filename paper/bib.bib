	abstract = {The properties of the population of merging binary black holes encode some of the uncertain physics underlying the evolution of massive stars in binaries. The binary black hole merger rate and chirp-mass distribution are being measured by ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. We consider isolated binary evolution, and explore how accurately the physical model can be constrained with such observations by applying the Fisher information matrix to the merging black hole population simulated with the rapid binary-population synthesis code COMPAS. We investigate variations in four COMPAS parameters: common-envelope eﬃciency, kick-velocity dispersion, and mass-loss rates during the luminous blue variable and Wolf–Rayet stellar-evolutionary phases. We ﬁnd that ∼ 1000 observations would constrain these model parameters to a fractional accuracy of a few per cent. Given the empirically determined binary black hole merger rate, we can expect gravitational-wave observations alone to place strong constraints on the physics of stellar and binary evolution within a few years. Our approach can be extended to use other observational data sets; combining observations at diﬀerent evolutionary stages will lead to a better understanding of stellar and binary physics.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07766},
	abstract = {When we perform probabilistic inferences with the Gaia Mission data, we technically require a likelihood function, or a probability of the (raw-ish) data as a function of stellar (astrometric and photometric) properties. Unfortunately, we aren’t (at present) given access to the Gaia data directly; we are only given a Catalog of derived astrometric properties for the stars. How do we perform probabilistic inferences in this context? The answer—implicit in many publications—is that we should look at the Gaia Catalog as containing the parameters of a likelihood function, or a probability of the Gaia data, conditioned on stellar properties, evaluated at the location of the data. Concretely, my recommendation is to assume (for, say, the parallax) that the Catalogreported value and uncertainty are the mean and root-variance of a Gaussian function that can stand in for the true likelihood function. This is the implicit assumption in most Gaia literature to date; my only goal here is to make the assumption explicit. Certain technical choices by the Mission team slightly invalidate this assumption for DR1 (TGAS), but not seriously. Generalizing beyond Gaia, it is important to downstream users of any Catalog products that they deliver likelihood information about the fundamental data; this is a challenge for the probabilistic catalogs of the future.},

	abstract = {Using the gravitational microlensing event OGLE-2014-BLG-1186 as an instructive example, we present a systematic methodology for identifying the nature of localised deviations from single-lens point-source light curves, which ensures that 1) the claimed signal is substantially above the noise ﬂoor, 2) the inferred properties are robustly determined and their estimation not subject to confusion with systematic noise in the photometry, 3) there are no alternative viable solutions within the model framework that might have been missed. Assessing the photometric noise by means of an eﬀective model signiﬁcantly increases the sensitivity arising from an analysis of the total microlensing data set to more subtle perturbations, and thereby in particular to lowmass planets. With a time-scale tE ∼ 300 d and the brightness being signiﬁcantly above baseline for four years, OGLE-2014-BLG-1186 is particularly long. Consequently, annual parallax and binarity could be separated and robustly measured from the wing and the peak data, respectively. While we were able to establish the presence of binarity, we ﬁnd model light curves matching the features indicated by the acquired data (within the estimated noise) that involve either a binary lens or a binary source. Our binary-lens models indicate a planet of mass M2 = (45 ± 9) M⊕, orbiting a star of mass M1 = (0.35 ± 0.06) M , located at a distance DL = (1.7 ± 0.3) kpc from Earth, whereas our binary-source models suggest a brown-dwarf lens of M = (0.046 ± 0.007) M , located at a distance DL = (5.7 ± 0.9) kpc, with the source potentially being a (partially) eclipsing binary involving stars predicted to be of similar colour given the ratios between the luminosities and radii. The ambiguity in the interpretation would be resolved in favour of a lens binary by observing the luminous lens star separating from the source at the predicted proper motion of µ = (1.6 ± 0.3) mas yr−1, whereas it would be resolved in favour of a source binary if the source could be shown to be a (partially) eclipsing binary matching the obtained model parameters. We experienced that close binary source stars pose a challenge for claiming the detection of planets by microlensing in events where the source trajectory passes close to the central caustic near the lens star hosting the planet.},

New expressions are derived for the diﬀerent contributions to the noise budget on transit time-scales and the least-squares detection statistic for box-shaped transits, and their behaviour as a function of stellar mass is re-examined. Correlated noise that is constant with apparent stellar magnitude implies a steep decrease in detection probability at the high mass end which, when considered jointly with the radial velocity requirements, can severely limit the potential of otherwise promising surveys in star clusters. However, we ﬁnd that small-aperture, wide ﬁeld surveys may detect hot Neptunes whose radial velocity signal can be measured with present-day instrumentation in very nearby ({\textless} 100 pc) clusters.},

	abstract = {We present a new framework to characterize the occurrence rates of planet candidates identiﬁed by Kepler based on hierarchical Bayesian modeling, Approximate Bayesian Computing (ABC), and sequential importance sampling. For this study we adopt a simple 2-D grid in planet radius and orbital period as our model and apply our algorithm to estimate occurrence rates for Q1Q16 planet candidates orbiting around solar-type stars. We arrive at signiﬁcantly increased planet occurrence rates for small planet candidates (Rp {\textless} 1.25R⊕) at larger orbital periods (P {\textgreater} 80d) compared to the rates estimated by the more common inverse detection efﬁciency method. Our improved methodology estimates that the occurrence rate density of small planet candidates in the habitable zone of solar-type stars is 1.6−+01..25 per factor of 2 in planet radius and orbital period. Additionally, we observe a local minimum in the occurrence rate for strong planet candidates marginalized over orbital period between 1.5 and 2R⊕ that is consistent with previous studies. For future improvements, the forward modeling approach of ABC is ideally suited to incorporating multiple populations, such as planets, astrophysical false positives and pipeline false alarms, to provide accurate planet occurrence rates and uncertainties. Furthermore, ABC provides a practical statistical framework for answering complex questions (e.g., frequency of different planetary architectures) and providing sound uncertainties, even in the face of complex selection effects, observational biases, and follow-up strategies. In summary, ABC offers a powerful tool for accurately characterizing a wide variety of astrophysical populations.},

The binary is located at a distance of \$(3.08 {\textbackslash}pm 0.18)\$ kpc in the Galactic Plane, and the components have a projected separation of \$(0.43 {\textbackslash}pm 0.03)\$ AU. Two alternative solutions with much lower likelihoods are also discussed, an 8- and 6-\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm J\}\$ model and a 90- and 70-\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm J\}\$ model. Although disfavored at the 3-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ and 5-\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ levels, these alternatives cannot be rejected entirely. We show how the more-massive of these models could be tested with future direct imaging.},

	abstract = {Data compression has become one of the cornerstones of modern astronomical data analysis, with the vast majority of analyses compressing large raw datasets down to a manageable number of informative summaries. In this paper we provide a general procedure for optimally compressing N data down to n summary statistics, where n is equal to the number of parameters of interest. We show that compression to the score function – the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to the parameters –yields n compressed statistics that are optimal in the sense that they preserve the Fisher information content of the data. Our method generalizes earlier work on linear Karhunen-Lo´eve compression for Gaussian data whilst recovering both lossless linear compression and quadratic estimation as special cases when they are optimal. We give a uniﬁed treatment that also includes the general non-Gaussian case as long as mild regularity conditions are satisﬁed, producing optimal non-linear summary statistics when appropriate. As a worked example, we derive explicitly the n optimal compressed statistics for Gaussian data in the general case where both the mean and covariance depend on the parameters.},

	abstract = {Many statistical models in cosmology can be simulated forwards but have intractable likelihood functions. Likelihood-free inference methods allow us to perform Bayesian inference from these models using only forward simulations, free from any likelihood assumptions or approximations. Likelihood-free inference generically involves simulating mock data and comparing to the observed data; this comparison in data-space suﬀers from the curse of dimensionality and requires compression of the data to a small number of summary statistics to be tractable. In this paper we use massive asymptotically-optimal data compression to reduce the dimensionality of the dataspace to just one number per parameter, providing a natural and optimal framework for summary statistic choice for likelihood-free inference. Secondly, we present the ﬁrst cosmological application of Density Estimation Likelihood-Free Inference (delfi), which learns a parameterized model for joint distribution of data and parameters, yielding both the parameter posterior and the model evidence. This approach is conceptually simple, requires less tuning than traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation approaches to likelihood-free inference and can give high-ﬁdelity posteriors from orders of magnitude fewer forward simulations. As an additional bonus, it enables parameter inference and Bayesian model comparison simultaneously. We demonstrate Density Estimation Likelihood-Free Inference with massive data compression on an analysis of the joint light-curve analysis supernova data, as a simple validation case study. We show that high-ﬁdelity posterior inference is possible for full-scale cosmological data analyses with as few as ∼ 104 simulations, with substantial scope for further improvement, demonstrating the scalability of likelihood-free inference to large and complex cosmological datasets.},

	abstract = {Converting a noisy parallax measurement into a posterior belief over distance requires inference with a prior. Usually this prior represents beliefs about the stellar density distribution of the Milky Way. However, multi-band photometry exists for a large fraction of the {\textbackslash}textsl\{{\textbackslash}small\{Gaia\}\} {\textbackslash}textsl\{{\textbackslash}small\{TGAS\}\} Catalog and is incredibly informative about stellar distances. Here we use {\textbackslash}textsl\{{\textbackslash}small\{2MASS\}\} colors for 1.4 million {\textbackslash}textsl\{{\textbackslash}small\{TGAS\}\} stars to build a noise-deconvolved empirical prior distribution for stars in color--magnitude space. This model contains no knowledge of stellar astrophysics or the Milky Way, but is precise because it accurately generates a large number of noisy parallax measurements under an assumption of stationarity; that is, it is capable of combining the information from many stars. We use the Extreme Deconvolution ({\textbackslash}textsl\{{\textbackslash}small\{XD\}\}) algorithm---an Empirical Bayes approximation to a full hierarchical model of the true parallax and photometry of every star---to construct this prior. The prior is combined with a {\textbackslash}textsl\{{\textbackslash}small\{TGAS\}\} likelihood to infer a precise photometric parallax estimate and uncertainty (and full posterior) for every star. Our parallax estimates are more precise than the {\textbackslash}textsl\{{\textbackslash}small\{TGAS\}\} catalog entries by a median factor of 1.2 (14\% are more precise by a factor {\textgreater}2) and are more precise than previous Bayesian distance estimates that use spatial priors. We validate our parallax inferences using members of the Milky Way star cluster M67, which is not visible as a cluster in the {\textbackslash}textsl\{{\textbackslash}small\{TGAS\}\} parallax estimates, but appears as a cluster in our posterior parallax estimates. Our results, including a parallax posterior pdf for each of 1.4 million {\textbackslash}textsl\{{\textbackslash}small\{TGAS\}\} stars, are available in companion electronic tables.},

	abstract = {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for model assessment, model comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

	abstract = {We present a substantial extension of the millimeter (mm) wave continuum photometry catalog for circumstellar dust disks in the Taurus star-forming region, based on a new “snapshot” λ = 1.3 mm survey with the Submillimeter Array. Combining these new data with measurements in the literature, we construct a mm-wave luminosity distribution, f (Lmm), for Class II disks that is statistically complete for stellar hosts with spectral types earlier than M8.5 and has a 3σ depth of roughly 3 mJy. The resulting census eliminates a longstanding selection bias against disks with late-type hosts, and thereby demonstrates that there is a strong correlation between Lmm and the host spectral type. By translating the locations of individual stars in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram into masses and ages, and adopting a simple conversion between Lmm and the disk mass, Md, we conﬁrm that this correlation corresponds to a statistically robust relationship between the masses of dust disks and the stars that host them. A Bayesian regression technique is used to characterize these relationships in the presence of measurement errors, data censoring, and signiﬁcant intrinsic scatter: the best-ﬁt results indicate a typical 1.3 mm ﬂux density of ∼25 mJy for 1 M hosts and a power-law scaling Lmm ∝ M∗1.5−2.0. We suggest that a reasonable treatment of dust temperature in the conversion from Lmm to Md favors an inherently linear Md ∝ M∗ scaling, with a typical disk-to-star mass ratio of ∼0.2\%–0.6\%. The measured rms dispersion around this regression curve is ±0.7 dex, suggesting that the combined effects of diverse evolutionary states, dust opacities, and temperatures in these disks imprint a full width at half-maximum range of a factor of ∼40 on the inferred Md (or Lmm) at any given host mass. We argue that this relationship between Md and M∗ likely represents the origin of the inferred correlation between giant planet frequency and host star mass in the exoplanet population, and provides some basic support for the core accretion model for planet formation. Moreover, we caution that the effects of incompleteness and selection bias must be considered in comparative studies of disk evolution, and illustrate that fact with statistical comparisons of f (Lmm) between the Taurus catalog presented here and incomplete subsamples in the Ophiuchus, IC 348, and Upper Sco young clusters.},

	abstract = {Variability in the light curves of spotted, rotating stars is often non-sinusoidal and quasiperiodic — spots move on the stellar surface and have ﬁnite lifetimes, causing stellar ﬂux variations to slowly shift in phase. A strictly periodic sinusoid therefore cannot accurately model a rotationally modulated stellar light curve. Physical models of stellar surfaces have many drawbacks preventing eﬀective inference, such as highly degenerate or high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work, we test an appropriate eﬀective model: a Gaussian Process with a quasi-periodic covariance kernel function. This highly ﬂexible model allows sampling of the posterior probability density function of the periodic parameter, marginalising over the other kernel hyperparameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. To test the eﬀectiveness of this method, we infer rotation periods from 333 simulated stellar light curves, demonstrating that the Gaussian process method produces periods that are more accurate than both a sineﬁtting periodogram and an autocorrelation function method. We also demonstrate that it works well on real data, by inferring rotation periods for 275 Kepler stars with previously measured periods. We provide a table of rotation periods for these 1102 Kepler objects of interest and their posterior probability density function samples. Because this method delivers posterior probability density functions, it will enable hierarchical studies involving stellar rotation, particularly those involving population modelling, such as inferring stellar ages, obliquities in exoplanet systems, or characterising star-planet interactions. The code used to implement this method is available online.},

This is derived from the publicly available Kepler data, using an automated search algorithm and debiasing process to produce occurrence rates implied by the seven systems already known. These rates depend critically on the planetary inclination distribution: if circumbinary planets are preferentially coplanar with their host binaries, as has been suggested, then the rate of occurrence of planets with Rp {\textgreater} 6R⊕ orbiting with Pp {\textless} 300 d is 10.0+−168.5 per cent (95 per cent conﬁdence limits), higher than but consistent with single star rates. If on the other hand the underlying planetary inclination distribution is isotropic, then this occurrence rate rises dramatically, to give a lower limit of 47 per cent. This implies that formation and subsequent dynamical evolution in circumbinary discs must either lead to largely coplanar planets, or proceed with signiﬁcantly greater ease than in circumstellar discs. As a result of this investigation, we also show that giant planets ({\textgreater}10R⊕) are signiﬁcantly less common in circumbinary orbits than their smaller siblings, and conﬁrm that the proposed shortfall of circumbinary planets orbiting the shorter period binaries in the Kepler sample is a real effect.},

Here we describe a machine learning algorithm that forms an integral part of the pipeline for the NGTS transit survey, demonstrating the eﬃcacy of machine learning in selecting planetary candidates from multi-night ground based survey data. Our method uses a combination of random forests and self-organising-maps to rank planetary candidates, achieving an AUC score of 97.6\% in ranking 12368 injected planets against 27496 false positives in the NGTS data. We build on past examples by using injected transit signals to form a training set, a necessary development for applying similar methods to upcoming surveys. We also make the autovet code used to implement the algorithm publicly accessible. autovet is designed to perform machine learned vetting of planetary candidates, and can utilise a variety of methods. The apparent robustness of machine learning techniques, whether on space-based or the qualitatively diﬀerent ground-based data, highlights their importance to future surveys such as TESS and PLATO and the need to better understand their advantages and pitfalls in an exoplanetary context.},

We present a method to investigate such systematics in microlensing datasets using the microlensing event OGLE-2013-BLG-0446 as a case study. The event was observed from multiple sites around the world and its high magniﬁcation (Amax ∼ 3000) allowed us to investigate the eﬀects of terrestrial and annual parallax. Real-time modeling of the event while it was still ongoing suggested the presence of an extremely low-mass companion (∼ 3M⊕) to the lensing star, leading to substantial follow-up coverage of the light curve. We test and compare diﬀerent models for the light curve and conclude that the data do not favour the planetary interpretation when systematic errors are taken into account.},

	abstract = {Microlensing is able to reveal multiple body systems located several kilo-parsec away from the Earth. Since it does not require the measurement of light from the lens, microlensing is sensitive to a range of objects from free-ﬂoating planets to stellar black holes. But if the lens emits enough light, the microlensing model predictions can be tested with high-resolution imaging and/or radial velocity methods. Such follow-up was done for the microlensing event OGLE-2011-BLG-0417, which was expected to be a close by (≤ 1 kpc), lowmass (∼ 0.8M ) binary star with a period P ∼ 1.4 yr. The spectroscopic follow-up observations conducted with the VLT did not measure any variation in the radial velocity, in strong contradiction with the published microlensing model. In the present work, we remodel this event and ﬁnd a simpler model in agreement with all the available measurements, including the recent GAIA DR2 parallax constraints. We also present a new way to distinguish degenerate models by using the GAIA DR2 proper motions. This work stresses the importance of thorough microlensing modeling, especially with the horizon of the WFIRST and the Euclid microlensing space missions.},

A ﬁrst estimate can be obtained by measuring the microlensing parallax eﬀect produced by either the motion of the Earth (annual parallax) or the contemporaneous observation of the lensing event from two (or more) observatories (space or terrestrial parallax) suﬃciently separated from each other. Further developing ideas originally outlined by Gould (2013) and Mogavero \& Beaulieu (2016), we review the possibility of measuring systematically the microlensing parallax using a telescope based on the Moon surface and other space-based observing platforms including the upcoming WFIRST space-telescope. We ﬁrst generalize the Fisher matrix formulation and present results demonstrating the advantage for each observing scenario. We conclude by outlining the limitation of the Fisher matrix analysis when submitted to a practical data modeling process. By considering a lunar-based parallax observation we ﬁnd that parameter correlations introduce a signiﬁcant loss in detection eﬃciency of the probed lunar parallax eﬀect.},

	abstract = {For the vast majority of stars in the second Gaia data release, reliable distances cannot be obtained by inverting the parallax. A correct inference procedure must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity of the transformation and the asymmetry of the resulting probability distribution. Here we infer distances to essentially all 1.33 billion stars with parallaxes published in the second Gaia data release. This is done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric conﬁdence interval. Although more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using additional data (such as photometry), our goal is to provide purely geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions about the physical properties of, or interstellar extinction towards, individual stars. We analyse the characteristics of the catalogue and validate it using clusters. The catalogue can be queried using ADQL at http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/tap.html (which also hosts the Gaia catalogue) as the table geometric distance in the schema gaiadr2 complements. The catalogue will go live on or before 30 April. Before that you can access it as a set of CSV ﬁles from http://www.mpia.de/∼calj/gdr2 distances.html.},

We examine the accuracy of the tree codes through comparison with a direct code over a much wider range of parameter space than has been feasible before. We demonstrate that all three codes present comparable accuracy, and choice of approach depends on considerations relating to the scale and nature of the microlensing problem under investigation. On current hardware, there is little difference in the processing speed of the single-core CPU tree code and the GPU direct code, however the recent plateau in singlecore CPU speeds means the existing tree code is no longer able to take advantage of Moore’s law-like increases in processing speed. Instead, we anticipate a rapid increase in GPU capabilities in the next few years, which is advantageous to the direct code. We suggest that progress in other areas of astrophysical computation may beneﬁt from a transition to GPUs through the use of ‘‘brute force” algorithms, rather than attempting to port the current best solution directly to a GPU language – for certain classes of problems, the simple implementation on GPUs may already be no worse than an optimised single-core CPU version.},

While several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this alignment, to date, a theoretical model that can successfully account for the observations remains elusive. In this work we show that the orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects cluster not only in argument of perihelion, but also in physical space. We demonstrate that the perihelion positions and orbital planes of the objects are tightly conﬁned and that such a clustering has only a probability of 0.007\% to be due to chance, thus requiring a dynamical origin. We ﬁnd that the observed orbital alignment can be maintained by a distant eccentric planet with mass 10 m⊕ whose orbit lies in approximately the same plane as those of the distant Kuiper belt objects, but whose perihelion is 180 degrees away from the perihelia of the minor bodies. In addition to accounting for the observed orbital alignment, the existence of such a planet naturally explains the presence of high perihelion Sedna-like objects, as well as the known collection of high semimajor axis objects with inclinations between 60 and 150 degrees whose origin was previously unclear.

	abstract = {Motivated by the large number of compact extrasolar planetary systems discovered by the Kepler Mission, this paper considers perturbations due to possible additional outer planets. The discovered compact systems sometimes contain multiple transiting planets, so that their orbital angular momentum vectors are tightly aligned. Since planetary orbits are susceptible to forced oscillations of their inclination angles, the highly aligned nature of these systems places constraints on possible additional (non-transiting) planets. If planets in the outer regions of these solar systems have suﬃciently large mass or suﬃciently small semi-major axis, they will induce the compact inner orbits to oscillate in and out of a transiting conﬁguration. This paper considers the dynamics of the compact systems discovered to host ﬁve or more planets. In order to not perturb these systems out of a continually, mutually transiting state, additional planetary companions must generally have periastron p {\textgreater} 10 AU. Speciﬁc constraints are found for each of the 18 planetary systems considered, which are obtained by marginalising over other orbital parameters using three diﬀerent choices of priors for the companion properties (a uniform prior, a transit-inspired prior, and an non-transiting disk prior). A separate ensemble of numerical experiments shows that these compact systems generally cannot contain Jupiter-analogs without disrupting the observed orbits. We also consider how these constraints depend on system properties and ﬁnd that the surface density of the planetary system is one of the most important variables. Finally, we provide speciﬁc results for two systems, WASP-47 and Kepler-20, for which this analysis provides interesting constraints.},

In presence of an additional planetary companion, a precise characterization of the system’s orbital state can yield meaningful constraints on the transiting planet’s interior structure. However, such methods can require a very speciﬁc type of system. This paper explores the dynamic range of applicability of these methods and shows that interior structure calculations are possible for a wide array of orbital architectures. The HAT-P-13 system is used as a case study, and the implications of perturbations arising from a third distant companion on the feasibility of an interior calculation are discussed. We ﬁnd that the method discussed here is likely to be useful in studying other planetary systems, allowing the possibility of an expanded survey of the interiors of exoplanets.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00503},
	abstract = {Extreme-precision radial velocity (EPRV) exoplanet surveys face considerable data analysis challenges in extracting maximally precise RVs from spectra. Chief among these, particularly for the upcoming generation of red-optimized spectrographs targeting M dwarfs, is the presence of telluric absorption features which are not perfectly known. Another major limitation on the achievable RV precision is the need to adopt an imperfect stellar template against which to cross-correlate or otherwise match the observations. In both cases, precision-limiting reliance on external information can be sidestepped using the data directly. Here we propose a data-driven method to simultaneously extract precise RVs and infer the underlying stellar and telluric spectra using a linear model (in the log of ﬂux). The model employs a convex objective and convex regularization to keep the optimization of the spectral components fast. We implement this method in wobble, an open-source python package which uses TensorFlow in one of its ﬁrst non-neural-network applications to astronomical data. In this work, we demonstrate the performance of wobble on archival HARPS spectra. We recover the canonical exoplanet 51 Pegasi b, detect the secular RV evolution of the M dwarf Barnard’s Star, and retrieve the Rossiter-McLaughlin eﬀect for the Hot Jupiter HD 189733b. The method additionally produces extremely high-S/N composite stellar spectra and detailed time-variable telluric spectra, which we also present here.},

	abstract = {Machine learning techniques have been successfully used to classify variable stars on widely-studied astronomical surveys. These datasets have been available to astronomers long enough, thus allowing them to perform deep analysis over several variable sources and generating useful catalogs with identiﬁed variable stars. The products of these studies are labeled data that enable supervised learning models to be trained successfully. However, when these models are blindly applied to data from new sky surveys their performance drops signiﬁcantly. Furthermore, unlabeled data becomes available at a much higher rate than its labeled counterpart, since labeling is a manual and time-consuming eﬀort. Domain adaptation techniques aim to learn from a domain where labeled data is available, the source domain, and through some adaptation perform well on a diﬀerent domain, the target domain. We propose a full probabilistic model that represents the joint distribution of features from two surveys as well as a probabilistic transformation of the features between one survey to the other. This allows us to transfer labeled data to a study where it is not available and to eﬀectively run a variable star classiﬁcation model in a new survey. Our model represents the features of each domain as a Gaussian mixture and models the transformation as a translation, rotation and scaling of each separate component. We perform tests using three diﬀerent variability catalogs: EROS, MACHO, and HiTS, presenting diﬀerences among them, such as the amount of observations per star, cadence, observational time and optical bands observed, among others.},

Planet population synthesis provides such a link. The approach allows to study how different physical models of individual processes (e.g., proto-planetary disc structure and evolution, planetesimal formation, gas accretion, migration, etc.) affect the overall properties of the population of emerging planets. By necessity, planet population synthesis relies on simplified descriptions of complex processes. These descriptions can be obtained from more detailed specialised simulations of these processes. The objective of this chapter is twofold: 1) provide an overview of the physics entering in the two main approaches to planet population synthesis and 2) present some of the results achieved as well as illustrate how it can be used to extract constraints on the models and to help interpret observations.},

	abstract = {A large number of direct imaging surveys for exoplanets have been performed in recent years, yielding the ﬁrst directly imaged planets and providing constraints on the prevalence and distribution of wide planetary systems. However, like most of the radial velocity ones, these generally focus on single stars, hence binaries and higher-order multiples have not been studied to the same level of scrutiny. This motivated the Search for Planets Orbiting Two Stars (SPOTS) survey, which is an ongoing direct imaging study of a large sample of close binaries, started with VLT/NACO and now continuing with VLT/SPHERE. To complement this survey, we have identiﬁed the close binary targets in 24 published direct imaging surveys. Here we present our statistical analysis of this combined body of data. We analysed a sample of 117 tight binary systems, using a combined Monte Carlo and Bayesian approach to derive the expected values of the frequency of companions, for diﬀerent values of the companion’s semi-major axis. Our analysis suggest that the frequency of sub-stellar companions in wide orbit is moderately low (∼{\textless}13\% with a best value of 6\% at 95\% conﬁdence level) and not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between single stars and tight binaries. One implication of this result is that the very high frequency of circumbinary planets in wide orbits around post-common envelope binaries, implied by eclipse timing, cannot be uniquely due to planets formed before the common-envelope phase (ﬁrst generation planets), supporting instead the second generation planet formation or a non-Keplerian origin of the timing variations.},

We ﬁnd good to excellent evidence for a third body in 222 systems via either the light-traveltime (LTTE) or dynamical effect delays. Approximately half of these systems have been discussed in previous work, while the rest are newly reported here. Via detailed analysis of the ETV curves using high-level analytic approximations, we are able to extract system masses and information about the three-dimensional characteristics of the triple for 62 systems which exhibit both LTTE and dynamical delays; for the remaining 160 systems, we give improved LTTE solutions. New techniques of pre-processing the ﬂux time series are applied to eliminate false positive triples and to enhance the ETV curves. The set of triples with outer orbital periods shorter than ∼2000 d is now sufﬁciently numerous for meaningful statistical analysis. We ﬁnd that (i) there is a peak near im 40◦ in the distribution of the triple versus inner binary mutual inclination angles that provides strong conﬁrmation of the operation of Kozai–Lidov cycles with tidal friction; (ii) the median eccentricity of the third-body orbits is e2 = 0.35; (iii) there is a deﬁcit of triple systems with binary periods 1 d and outer periods between ∼50 and 200 d which might help guide the reﬁnement of theories of the formation and evolution of close binaries; and (iv) the substantial fraction of Kepler binaries which have third-body companions is consistent with a very large fraction of all binaries being part of triples.},

	abstract = {We investigate the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometry from Data Release 8 (DR8) in the search for systematic trends that still exist after the calibration effort of Padmanabhan et al. We consider both the aperture and point spread function (PSF) magnitudes in DR8. Using the objects with repeat observations, we ﬁnd that a large proportion of the aperture magnitudes suffer an ∼0.2–2 per cent systematic trend as a function of PSF full width at half-maximum (FWHM), the amplitude of which increases for fainter objects. Analysis of the PSF magnitudes reveals more complicated systematic trends of similar amplitude as a function of PSF FWHM and object brightness. We suspect that sky oversubtraction is the cause of the largest amplitude trends as a function of PSF FWHM. We also detect systematic trends as a function of subpixel coordinates for the PSF magnitudes with peak-to-peak amplitudes of ∼1.6 and ∼4–7 mmag for the over- and undersampled images, respectively. We note that the systematic trends are similar in amplitude to the reported ∼1 and ∼2 per cent precision of the SDSS photometry in the griz and u wavebands, respectively, and therefore their correction has the potential to substantially improve the SDSS photometric precision. We provide an IDL program speciﬁcally for this purpose. Finally, we note that the SDSS aperture and PSF magnitude scales are related by a non-linear transformation that departs from linearity by ∼1–4 per cent, which, without correction, invalidates the application of a photometric calibration model derived from the aperture magnitudes to the PSF magnitudes, as has been done for SDSS DR8.},

This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in ﬁelds outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets.

	abstract = {Many inference problems involve inferring the number N of components in some region, along with their properties \{xi\}Ni=1, from a dataset D. A common statistical example is ﬁnite mixture modelling. In the Bayesian framework, these problems are typically solved using one of the following two methods: i) by executing a Monte Carlo algorithm (such as Nested Sampling) once for each possible value of N , and calculating the marginal likelihood or evidence as a function of N ; or ii) by doing a single run that allows the model dimension N to change (such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo with birth/death moves), and obtaining the posterior for N directly. In this paper we present a general approach to this problem that uses trans-dimensional MCMC embedded within a Nested Sampling algorithm, allowing us to explore the posterior distribution and calculate the marginal likelihood (summed over N ) even if the problem contains a phase transition or other diﬃcult features such as multimodality. We present two example problems, ﬁnding sinusoidal signals in noisy data, and ﬁnding and measuring galaxies in a noisy astronomical image. Both of the examples demonstrate phase transitions in the relationship between the likelihood and the cumulative prior mass, highlighting the need for Nested Sampling.},

While NS technically requires independent generation of particles, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) exploration ﬁts naturally into this technique. We illustrate the new method on a test problem and ﬁnd that it can achieve four times the accuracy of classic MCMC-based Nested Sampling, for the same computational effort; equivalent to a factor of 16 speedup. An additional beneﬁt is that more samples and a more accurate evidence value can be obtained simply by continuing the run for longer, as in standard MCMC.},

	abstract = {Inferring the number of planets N in an exoplanetary system from radial velocity (RV) data is a challenging task. Recently, it has become clear that RV data can contain periodic signals due to stellar activity, which can be difﬁcult to distinguish from planetary signals. However, even doing the inference under a given set of simplifying assumptions (e.g. no stellar activity) can be difﬁcult. It is common for the posterior distribution for the planet parameters, such as orbital periods, to be multimodal and to have other awkward features. In addition, when N is unknown, the marginal likelihood (or evidence) as a function of N is required. Rather than doing separate runs with different trial values of N, we propose an alternative approach using a transdimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method within nested sampling. The posterior distribution for N can be obtained with a single run. We apply the method to ν Oph and Gliese 581, ﬁnding moderate evidence for additional signals in ν Oph with periods of 36.11 ± 0.034, 75.58 ± 0.80, and 1709 ± 183 d; the posterior probability that at least one of these exists is 85 per cent. The results also suggest Gliese 581 hosts many (7–15) ‘planets’ (or other causes of other periodic signals), but only 4–6 have well determined periods. The analysis of both of these data sets shows phase transitions exist which are difﬁcult to negotiate without nested sampling.},

	abstract = {If an extended source, such as a galaxy, is gravitationally lensed by a massive object in the foreground, the lensing distorts the observed image. It is straightforward to simulate what the observed image would be for a particular lens and source combination. In practice, one observes the lensed image on the sky, albeit blurred by atmospheric and telescopic effects and also contaminated with noise. The question that then arises is, given this incomplete data, what combinations of lens mass distribution and source surface brightness proﬁle could plausibly have produced this image? This is a classic example of an inverse problem, and the method for solving it is given by the framework of Bayesian inference. In this paper we demonstrate the application of Bayesian inference to the problem of gravitational lens reconstruction and illustrate the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, which can be used when the analytical calculations become too difﬁcult. Previous methods for performing gravitational lens inversion are seen in a new light, as special cases of the general approach presented in this paper. Thus, we are able to answer, at least in principle, lingering questions about the uncertainties in the reconstructed source and lens parameters, taking into account all of the data and any prior information we may have.},

To begin this process, oscillation frequencies must be extracted from the observational data, typically time series of the star’s brightness or radial velocity. In this paper, a probabilistic model is introduced for inferring the frequencies and amplitudes of stellar oscillation modes from data, assuming that there is some periodic character to the oscillations, but that they may not be exactly sinusoidal. Effectively, we ﬁt damped oscillations to the time series, and hence the mode lifetime is also recovered. While this approach is computationally demanding for large time series ({\textgreater}1500 points), it should at least allow improved analysis of observations of solar-like oscillations in subgiant and red giant stars, as well as sparse observations of semiregular stars, where the number of points in the time series is often low. The method is demonstrated on simulated data and then applied to radial velocity measurements of the red giant star ξ Hydrae, yielding a mode lifetime between 0.41 and 2.65 d with 95 per cent posterior probability. The large frequency separation between modes is ambiguous, however we argue that the most plausible value is 6.3 μHz, based on the radial velocity data and the star’s position in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram.},

If the drawn points are distributed uniformly, the removal of a point shrinks the volume in a well-understood way, and the integration of nested sampling is unbiased. In this work, I develop a statistical test to check whether this is the case. This "Shrinkage Test" is useful to verify nested sampling algorithms in a controlled environment. I apply the shrinkage test to a test-problem, and show that some existing algorithms fail to pass it due to over-optimisation. I then demonstrate that a simple algorithm can be constructed which is robust against this type of problem. This RADFRIENDS algorithm is, however, ineﬃcient in comparison to MULTINEST.},

	abstract = {We re-examine the statistical conﬁrmation of small long-period Kepler planet candidates in light of recent improvements in our understanding of the occurrence of systematic false alarms in this regime. Using the ﬁnal Data Release 25 (DR25) Kepler planet candidate catalog statistics, we ﬁnd that the previously conﬁrmed single planet system Kepler-452b no longer achieves a 99\% conﬁdence in the planetary hypothesis and is not considered statistically validated in agreement with the ﬁnding of Mullally et al. (2018). For multiple planet systems, we ﬁnd that the planet prior enhancement for belonging to a multiple planet system is suppressed relative to previous Kepler catalogs, and we identify the multi-planet system member, Kepler-186f, no longer achieves a 99\% conﬁdence in the planetary hypothesis. Because of the numerous confounding factors in the data analysis process that leads to the detection and characterization of a signal, it is diﬃcult to determine whether any one planetary candidate achieves a strict criterion for conﬁrmation relative to systematic false alarms. For instance, when taking into account a simpliﬁed model of processing variations, the additional single planet systems Kepler-443b, Kepler-441b, Kepler-1633b, Kepler-1178b, and Kepler-1653b have a nonnegligible probability of falling below a 99\% conﬁdence in the planetary hypothesis. The systematic false alarm hypothesis must be taken into account when employing statistical validation techniques in order to conﬁrm planet candidates that approach the detection threshold of a survey. We encourage those performing transit searches of K2, TESS, and other similar data sets to quantify their systematic false alarms rates. Alternatively, independent photometric detection of the transit signal or radial velocity measurements can eliminate the false alarm hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Transiting hot Jupiters occupy a wedge-shaped region in the mass ratio-orbital separation diagram. Its upper boundary is eroded by tidal spiral-in of massive, close-in planets and is sensitive to the stellar tidal dissipation parameter Qs. We develop a simple generative model of the orbital separation distribution of the known population of transiting hot Jupiters, subject to tidal orbital decay, XUV-driven evaporation and observational selection bias. From the joint likelihood of the observed orbital separations of hot Jupiters discovered in ground-based wide-ﬁeld transit surveys, measured with respect to the hyperparameters of the underlying population model, we recover narrow posterior probability distributions for Qs in two diﬀerent tidal forcing frequency regimes. We validate the method using mock samples of transiting planets with known tidal parameters. We ﬁnd that Qs and its temperature dependence are retrieved reliably over ﬁve orders of magnitude in Qs. A large sample of hot Jupiters from small-aperture ground-based surveys yields log10 Qs = (8.26 ± 0.14) for 223 systems in the equilibrium-tide regime. We detect no signiﬁcant dependence of Qs on stellar eﬀective temperature. A further 19 systems in the dynamical-tide regime yield log10 Qs = 7.3 ± 0.4, indicating stronger coupling. Detection probabilities for transiting planets at a given orbital separation scale inversely with the increase in their tidal migration rates since birth. The resulting bias towards younger systems explains why the surface gravities of hot Jupiters correlate with their host stars’ chromospheric emission ﬂuxes. We predict departures from a linear transit-timing ephemeris of less than 4 seconds for WASP-18 over a 20-year baseline.},

Four statistical models were trained with repeated cross validation and evaluated in a testing set: (a) multiple linear regression, (b) support vector machine with radial kernel, (c) random forest and (d) gradient boosting machines (GBM). The best model (GBM) was able to explain 97\% of the variance (R2) in the training set and with 57\% in the testing set when using all the predictors. From the wireless network, the data from the kitchen, laundry and living room were ranked the highest in importance for the energy prediction. The prediction models with only the weather data, selected the atmospheric pressure (which is correlated to wind speed) as the most relevant weather data variable in the prediction. Therefore, atmospheric pressure may be important to include in energy prediction models and for building performance modeling.},

	abstract = {We present Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation, or BAGPIPES, a new Python tool which can be used to rapidly generate complex model galaxy spectra and to fit these to arbitrary combinations of spectroscopic and photometric data using the MultiNest nested sampling algorithm. We extensively test our ability to recover realistic star-formation histories (SFHs) by fitting mock observations of quiescent galaxies from the MUFASA simulation. We then perform a detailed analysis of the SFHs of a sample of 9289 quiescent galaxies from UltraVISTA with stellar masses, \$M\_* {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and redshifts \$0.25 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.75\$. The majority of our sample exhibit SFHs which rise gradually then quench relatively rapidly, over \$1\{-\}2\$ Gyr. This behaviour is consistent with recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, where AGN-driven feedback in the low-accretion (jet) mode is the dominant quenching mechanism. At \$z {\textgreater} 1\$ we also find a class of objects with SFHs which rise and fall very rapidly, with quenching timescales of \${\textless} 1\$ Gyr, consistent with quasar-mode AGN feedback. Finally, at \$z {\textless} 1\$ we find a population with SFHs which quench more slowly than they rise, over \${\textgreater}3\$ Gyr, which we speculate to be the result of diminishing overall cosmic gas supply. We confirm the mass-accelerated evolution (downsizing) trend, and a trend towards more rapid quenching at higher stellar masses. However, our results suggest that the latter is a natural consequence of mass-accelerated evolution, rather than a change in quenching physics with stellar mass. We find \$61{\textbackslash}pm8\$ per cent of \$z {\textgreater} 1.5\$ massive quenched galaxies undergo significant further evolution by \$z = 0.5\$.

Such events potentially contain much information on the physical properties of the observed binary systems, which can then be used for e.g. statistical studies on binary objects in the Galactic disk or bulge. However, such events are usually not straightforward to study, because the model equations are strongly non-linear and there are many local minima that can fool the search for the best solution if the parameter space is not inspected with great care. In this work an alternative parameterisation for the binary lens ﬁtting problem is proposed, in which the parameters involved are deﬁned to represent as closely as possible the caustic-crossing features observed in most binary lens light curves. Furthermore, we work out an extension of the method in order to make use of the straight line fold caustic approximation, when the latter applies for both the caustic entry and exit. Methods. We introduce an alternative parameterisation in order to conﬁne the exploration of the parameter space to regions where the models only involve caustic crossing at the dates seen in the light curve.},

When only simulations are available, these summaries are typically chosen heuristically, so they may inadvertently miss important information. We introduce a simulation-based machine learning technique that trains artificial neural networks to find non-linear functionals of data that maximise Fisher information: information maximising neural networks (IMNNs). In test cases where the posterior can be derived exactly, likelihood-free inference based on automatically derived IMNN summaries produces nearly exact posteriors, showing that these summaries are good approximations to sufficient statistics. In a series of numerical examples of increasing complexity and astrophysical relevance we show that IMNNs are robustly capable of automatically finding optimal, non-linear summaries of the data even in cases where linear compression fails: inferring the variance of Gaussian signal in the presence of noise; inferring cosmological parameters from mock simulations of the Lyman-\{{\textbackslash}alpha\} forest in quasar spectra; and inferring frequency-domain parameters from LISA-like detections of gravitational waveforms. In this final case, the IMNN summary outperforms linear data compression by avoiding the introduction of spurious likelihood maxima. We anticipate that the automatic physical inference method described in this paper will be essential to obtain both accurate and precise cosmological parameter estimates from complex and large astronomical data sets, including those from LSST and Euclid.},

We consider six models distinguished by binary separation, secondary mass and outﬂow mechanism. Each system consists of an Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star and an accreting secondary. The AGB star loses its mass via a wind. In one of our six models, the AGB star incurs a short period of outburst. In all cases, the secondary accretes part of the ejected mass and also inﬂuences the mass-loss rate of the AGB star. The ejected mass may remain gravitationally bound to the binary system and form a circumbinary disk, or contribute to an accretion disk around the secondary. In other cases, the ejecta will escape the binary system. The accretion rate onto the secondary changes non-linearly with binary separation. In our closest binary simulations, our models exemplify the Wind Roche-lobe Overﬂow (WROLF) while in our wide binary cases, the mass transfer exhibits BondiHoyle (BH) accretion. The morphologies of the outﬂows in the binary systems are varied. The variety may provide clues to how the late AGB phase inﬂuences Planetary Nebulae (PNe) shaping. We employ the adaptive-mesh-reﬁnement code AstroBEAR for our simulations and include ray-tracing, radiation transfer, cooling and dust formation.

The proposed method is based on particle swarm optimization and bivariate Normal Inverse Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, in the construction of the probability density function, this study selects planet-host stars with the GK-type. The injecting approach is also employed to solve the survey completeness of sample. The resulting occurrence rate of Earth analogs is 0.025 with a 95\% bootstrap confidence interval between 0.023 and 0.032.},

	abstract = {Recent transit surveys have discovered thousands of planetary candidates with directly measured radii, but only a small fraction have measured masses. Planetary mass is crucial in assessing the feasibility of numerous observational signatures, such as radial velocities (RVs), atmospheres, moons and rings. In the absence of a direct measurement, a data-driven, probabilistic forecast enables observational planning and so here we compute posterior distributions for the forecasted mass of approximately seven thousand Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs). Our forecasts reveal that the predicted RV amplitudes of Neptunian planets are relatively consistent, as a result of transit survey detection bias, hovering around the few m/s level. We ﬁnd that mass forecasts are unlikely to improve through more precise planetary radii, with the error budget presently dominated by the intrinsic model uncertainty. Our forecasts identify a couple of dozen KOIs near the Terran-Neptunian divide with particularly large RV semi-amplitudes which could be promising targets to follow-up, particularly in the near-IR. With several more transit surveys planned in the near-future, the need to quickly forecast observational signatures is likely to grow and the work here provides a template example of such calculations.},

	abstract = {Mass and radius are two of the most fundamental properties of an astronomical object. Increasingly, new planet discoveries are being announced with a measurement of one of these quantities, but not both. This has led to a growing need to forecast the missing quantity using the other, especially when predicting the detectability of certain follow-up observations. We present an unbiased forecasting model built upon a probabilistic mass–radius relation conditioned on a sample of 316 well-constrained objects. Our publicly available code, Forecaster, accounts for observational errors, hyper-parameter uncertainties, and the intrinsic dispersions observed in the calibration sample. By conditioning our model on a sample spanning dwarf planets to late-type stars, Forecaster can predict the mass (or radius) from the radius (or mass) for objects covering nine orders of magnitude in mass. Classiﬁcation is naturally performed by our model, which uses four classes we label as Terran worlds, Neptunian worlds, Jovian worlds, and stars. Our classiﬁcation identiﬁes dwarf planets as merely low-mass Terrans (like the Earth) and brown dwarfs as merely high-mass Jovians (like Jupiter). We detect a transition in the mass–radius relation at 2.0-+00..67 M⊕, which we associate with the divide between solid, Terran worlds and Neptunian worlds. This independent analysis adds further weight to the emerging consensus that rocky superEarths represent a narrower region of parameter space than originally thought. Effectively, then, the Earth is the super-Earth we have been looking for.},

Conditioned upon a single datum - the time of earliest evidence for life (tobs) - previous Bayesian formalisms for the posterior distribution of λ have demonstrated how inferences are highly sensitive to the priors. Rather than attempt to infer the true λ posterior, we here compute the relative change to λ when new experimental/observational evidence is introduced. By simulating posterior distributions and resulting entropic information gains, we compare three experimental pressures on λ: 1) evidence for an earlier start to life; tobs; 2) constraints on spontaneous abiogenesis from the lab; and 3) an exoplanet survey for biosignatures. First, we ﬁnd that experiments 1 and 2 can only yield lower limits on λ, unlike 3. Second, evidence for an earlier start to life can yield negligible information on λ if tobs λm−1ax. Vice versa, experiment 2 is uninformative when λmax to−b1s. Whilst experiment 3 appears the most direct means of measuring λ, we highlight that early starts inform us of the conditions of abiogenesis, and that lab experiments could succeed in building new life. Together then, the three experiments are complimentary and we encourage activity in all to solve this grand challenge.},

As these systems contain fully convective stars, magnetic braking is not believed to be operative, making the large orbital-period derivative puzzling. Here we explore whether a resonant interaction between the binary and a surrounding circumbinary (CB) disk could account for the observed orbital decay. Our calculations indicate that the observed orbital-period derivatives in seven detached binaries can be produced by the resonant interaction between the binary and a CB disk if the latter has a mass in the range of 10−4 − 10−2 M⊙, which is of the same order as the inferred disk mass (∼ 2.4 × 10−4 M⊙) in the post-common-envelope binary NN Ser.},

These binaries have directly and precisely measured total system masses of 0.025 M and 0.034 M , and projected separations of 0.31 AU and 0.19 AU, making them the lowestmass and tightest ﬁeld BD binaries known. The discovery of a population of such binaries indicates that BD binaries can robustly form at least down to masses of ∼0.02 M .

	abstract = {Motivated by the order of magnitude difference in the frequency of giant planets orbiting M dwarfs inferred by microlensing and radial velocity (RV) surveys, we present a method for comparing the statistical constraints on exoplanet demographics inferred from these methods. We ﬁrst derive the mapping from the observable parameters of a microlensing-detected planet to those of an analogous planet orbiting an RV-monitored star. Using this mapping, we predict the distribution of RV observables for the planet population inferred from microlensing surveys, taking care to adopt reasonable priors for, and properly marginalize over, the unknown physical parameters of microlensing-detected systems. Finally, we use simple estimates of the detection limits for a ﬁducial RV survey to predict the number and properties of analogs of the microlensing planet population such an RV survey should detect. We ﬁnd that RV and microlensing surveys have some overlap, speciﬁcally for super-Jupiter mass planets (mp 1 MJup) with periods between ∼3–10 yr. However, the steeply falling planetary mass function inferred from microlensing implies that, in this region of overlap, RV surveys should infer a much smaller frequency than the overall giant planet frequency (mp 0.1 MJup) inferred by microlensing. Our analysis demonstrates that it is possible to statistically compare and synthesize data sets from multiple exoplanet detection techniques in order to infer exoplanet demographics over wider regions of parameter space than are accessible to individual methods. In a companion paper, we apply our methodology to several representative microlensing and RV surveys to derive the frequency of planets around M dwarfs with orbits of 30 yr.},

This excess has been interpreted as a population of approximately Jupiter-mass objects that outnumber main-sequence stars nearly twofold; however the microlensing data alone cannot distinguish between events due to wide-separation (a  10 au) and free-ﬂoating planets. Assuming these STEs are indeed due to planetary-mass objects, we aim to constrain the fraction of these events that can be explained by bound but wideseparation planets. We ﬁt the observed timescale distribution with a lens mass function comprised of brown dwarfs, main-sequence stars, and stellar remnants, ﬁnding and thus corroborating the initial identiﬁcation of an excess of STEs. We then include a population of bound planets that are expected not to show signatures of the primary lens (host) in their microlensing light curves and that are also consistent with results from representative microlensing, radial velocity, and direct imaging surveys. We ﬁnd that bound planets alone cannot explain the entire STE excess without violating the constraints from the surveys we consider and thus some fraction of these events must be due to free-ﬂoating planets, if our model for bound planets holds. We estimate a median fraction of STEs due to free-ﬂoating planets to be f=0.67 (0.23  f  0.85 at 95\% conﬁdence) when assuming “hot-start” planet evolutionary models and f=0.58 (0.14  f  0.83 at 95\% conﬁdence) for “cold-start” models. Assuming a delta-function distribution of free-ﬂoating planets of mass mp = 2 MJup yields a number of free-ﬂoating planets per main-sequence star of N=1.4 (0.48  N  1.8 at 95\% conﬁdence) in the “hot-start” case and N=1.2 (0.29  N  1.8 at 95\% conﬁdence) in the “cold-start” case.},

	abstract = {We present a modular, extensible likelihood framework for spectroscopic inference based on synthetic model spectra. The subtraction of an imperfect model from a continuously sampled spectrum introduces covariance between adjacent datapoints (pixels) into the residual spectrum. For the high signal-to-noise data with large spectral range that is commonly employed in stellar astrophysics, that covariant structure can lead to dramatically underestimated parameter uncertainties (and, in some cases, biases). We construct a likelihood function that accounts for the structure of the covariance matrix, utilizing the machinery of Gaussian process kernels. This framework speciﬁcally address the common problem of mismatches in model spectral line strengths (with respect to data) due to intrinsic model imperfections (e.g., in the atomic/molecular databases or opacity prescriptions) by developing a novel local covariance kernel formalism that identiﬁes and self-consistently downweights pathological spectral line “outliers.” By ﬁtting many spectra in a hierarchical manner, these local kernels provide a mechanism to learn about and build data-driven corrections to synthetic spectral libraries. An opensource software implementation of this approach is available at http://iancze.github.io/Starfish, including a sophisticated probabilistic scheme for spectral interpolation when using model libraries that are sparsely sampled in the stellar parameters. We demonstrate some salient features of the framework by ﬁtting the high resolution V -band spectrum of WASP-14, an F5 dwarf with a transiting exoplanet, and the moderate resolution K-band spectrum of Gliese 51, an M5 ﬁeld dwarf.},

	abstract = {Measurements of radial velocity variations from the spectroscopic monitoring of stars and their companions are essential for a broad swath of astrophysics; these measurements provide access to the fundamental physical properties that dictate all phases of stellar evolution and facilitate the quantitative study of planetary systems. The conversion of those measurements into both constraints on the orbital architecture and individual component spectra can be a serious challenge, however, especially for extreme ﬂux ratio systems and observations with relatively low sensitivity. Gaussian processes deﬁne sampling distributions of ﬂexible, continuous functions that are well-motivated for modeling stellar spectra, enabling proﬁcient searches for companion lines in time-series spectra. We introduce a new technique for spectral disentangling, where the posterior distributions of the orbital parameters and intrinsic, rest-frame stellar spectra are explored simultaneously without needing to invoke crosscorrelation templates. To demonstrate its potential, this technique is deployed on red-optical time-series spectra of the mid-M-dwarf binary LP661-13. We report orbital parameters with improved precision compared to traditional radial velocity analysis and successfully reconstruct the primary and secondary spectra. We discuss potential applications for other stellar and exoplanet radial velocity techniques and extensions to time-variable spectra. The code used in this analysis is freely available as an open-source Python package.},

The ﬁrst planets detected by microlensing were well described by the two-point-mass model of a star with one planet. By the end of 2014, four events involving three-point-mass lenses had been announced. Two of the lenses were stars with two planetary companions each; two were binary stars with a planet orbiting one component. While the two-point-mass model is well understood, the same cannot be said for lenses with three or more components. Even the range of possible critical-curve topologies and caustic geometries of the three-point-mass lens remains unknown. In this paper we provide new tools for mapping the critical-curve topology and caustic cusp number in the parameter space of n-point-mass lenses. We perform our analysis in the image plane of the lens. We show that all contours of the Jacobian are critical curves of re-scaled versions of the lens conﬁguration. Utilizing this property further, we introduce the cusp curve to identify cusp-image positions on all contours simultaneously. In order to track cusp-number changes in caustic metamorphoses, we deﬁne the morph curve, which pinpoints the positions of metamorphosis-point images along the cusp curve. We demonstrate the usage of both curves on simple two- and three-point-mass lens examples. For the three simplest caustic metamorphoses we illustrate the local structure of the image and source planes.},

We conduct hydrodynamical simulations of self-gravitating discs around binary systems. The selected binary and disc parameters are chosen consistent with observed systems. The discs are evolved until they settle in a quasi-equilibrium and the resulting systems are compared with the parameters of Kepler 16, 34 and 35. We ﬁnd a close correspondence of the peak density at the inner disc gap and the orbit of the observed planets. We conclude, based on our simulations, that the orbits of the observed Kepler planets are determined by the size of the inner disc gap which for these systems results from the binary driving. This mediates planet formation either through the density enhancement or through planetary trapping at the density gradient inversion in the inner disc. For all three systems the current eccentricity of the planetary orbit is less than the disc eccentricity in the simulations. This, together with the long-term stability of the orbits argues against in situ formation (e.g. a direct collapse scenario of the material in the ring). Conducting additional simulations of systems with a wider range of parameters (taken from a survey of eclipsing binaries), we ﬁnd that the planet semimajor axis and binary eccentricity in such a scenario should be tightly correlated providing an observational test of this formation mechanism.},

Since the point-source magniﬁcation jumps to an inﬁnite value on caustics, special care is required. For a uniformly bright source, it has been shown earlier that the calculation simpliﬁes if one determines the magniﬁcation from the area of the images of the extended source by applying Green’s theorem so that one ends up with a one-dimensional integration over the image boundaries. This approach is discussed here in detail, and it is shown that it can be used to yield a robust and efﬁcient method also for limb-darkened sources.

	abstract = {The transition of the binary gravitational lens from the equal mass case to small (planetary) mass ratios q is studied. It is shown how the limit of a (pure shear) Chang-Refsdal lens is approached, under what conditions the Chang-Refsdal approximation is valid, and how the 3 different topologies of the critical curves and caustics for a binary lens are mapped onto the 2 different topologies for a Chang-Refsdal lens with pure shear. It is shown that for wide binaries, the lensing in the vicinity of both lens objects can be described by a Taylor-expansion of the deﬂection term due to the other object, where the Chang-Refsdal approximation corresponds to a truncation of this series. For close binaries, only the vicinity of the secondary, less massive, object can be described in this way. However, for image distances much larger than the separation of the lens objects, any binary lens can be approximated by means of multipole expansion, where the ﬁrst non-trivial term is the quadrupole term. It is shown that an ambiguity exists between wide and close binary lenses, where the shear at one of the objects due to the other object for the wide binary is equal to the absolute value of the eigenvalues of the quadrupole moment for the close binary. This analysis provides the basis for a classiﬁcation of binary lens microlensing events, especially of planetary events, and an understanding of present ambiguities.},

This paper presents a comprehensive guide for modelling and interpreting the light curves obtained in events involving fold-caustic passages. A new general, consistent and optimal choice of parameters provides a deep understanding of the involved features, avoids numerical difﬁculties and minimizes correlations between model parameters. While the photometric data of a microlensing event around a caustic passage itself do not provide constraints on the characteristics of the underlying binary lens and do not allow predictions of the behaviour of other regions of the light curve, vital constraints can be obtained in an efﬁcient way if these are combined with a few simple characteristics of data outside the caustic passages. A corresponding algorithm containing some improvements over an earlier approach, which takes into account multisite observations, is presented and discussed in detail together with the arising parameter constraints, paying special attention to the role of source and background ﬂuxes.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive new approach is presented for deriving probability densities of physical properties characterizing the lens and source that constitute an observed galactic microlensing event. While previously encountered problems are overcome, constraints from event anomalies and model parameter uncertainties can be incorporated into the estimates. Probability densities for given events need to be carefully distinguished from the statistical distribution of the same parameters among the underlying population from which the actual lenses and sources are drawn. Using given model distributions of the mass spectrum, the mass density, and the velocity distribution of Galactic disc and bulge constituents, probability densities of lens mass, distance, and the effective lens–source velocities are derived, where the effect on the distribution that arises from additional observations of annual parallax or ﬁnite-source effects, or the absence of signiﬁcant effects, is shown. The presented formalism can also be used to calculate probabilities for the lens to belong to one or another population and to estimate parameters that characterize anomalies. Finally, it is shown how detection efﬁciency maps for binary-lens companions in the physical parameters, such as companion mass and orbital semimajor axis, arise from values determined for the mass ratio and dimensionless projected separation parameter, including the deprojection of the orbital motion for elliptical orbits. Compared to the naive estimate based on ‘typical values’, the detection efﬁciency for low-mass companions is increased by mixing in higher detection efﬁciencies for smaller mass ratios (i.e. smaller masses of the primary).},

	abstract = {Some of the difﬁculties in determining the underlying physical properties that are relevant for observed anomalies in microlensing light curves, such as the mass and separation of extrasolar planets orbiting the lens star, or the relative source–lens parallax, are already anchored in factors that limit the amount of information available from ordinary microlensing events and in the way these are being parametrized. Moreover, a real-time detection of deviations from an ordinary light curve while these are still in progress can only be done against a known model of the latter, and such is also required for properly prioritizing ongoing events for monitoring in order to maximize scientiﬁc returns. Despite the fact that ordinary microlensing light curves are described by an analytic function that only involves a handful of parameters, modelling these is far less trivial than one might be tempted to think. A well-known degeneracy for small impacts, and another one for the initial rise of an event, makes an interprediction of different phases impossible, while in order to determine a complete set of model parameters, the fundamental characteristics of all these phases need to be properly assessed. While it is found that the wing of the light curve provides valuable information about the time-scale that absorbs the physical properties, the peak ﬂux of the event can be meaningfully predicted only after about a third of the total magniﬁcation has been reached. Parametrizations based on observable features not only ease modelling by bringing the covariance matrix close to diagonal form, but also allow good predictions of the measured ﬂux without the need to determine all parameters accurately. Campaigns intending to infer planet populations from observed microlensing events need to invest some fraction of the available time into acquiring data that allow to properly determine the magniﬁcation function.},

	abstract = {(abridged) The technique of gravitational microlensing is currently unique in its ability to provide a sample of terrestrial exoplanets around both Galactic disk and bulge stars, allowing to measure their abundance and determine their distribution with respect to mass and orbital separation. In order to achieve these goals in reasonable time, a well-coordinated effort involving a network of either 2m or 4 x 1m telescopes at each site is required. It could lead to the first detection of an Earth-mass planet outside the Solar system, and even planets less massive than Earth could be discovered. From April 2008, ARTEMiS (Automated Robotic Terrestrial Exoplanet Microlensing Search) is planned to provide a platform for a three-step strategy of survey, follow-up, and anomaly monitoring. As an expert system embedded in eSTAR (e-Science Telescopes for Astronomical Research), ARTEMiS will give advice on the optimal targets to be observed at any given time, and will also alert on deviations from ordinary microlensing light curves by means of the SIGNALMEN anomaly detector. While the use of the VOEvent (Virtual Observatory Event) protocol allows a direct interaction with the telescopes that are part of the HTN (Heterogeneous Telescope Networks) consortium, additional interfaces provide means of communication with all existing microlensing campaigns that rely on human observers. The success of discovering a planet by microlensing critically depends on the availability of a telescope in a suitable location at the right time, which can mean within 10 min. Real-time modelling offers the opportunity of live discovery of extra-solar planets, thereby providing ''Science live to your home''.},

	title = {{OGLE}-2014-{BLG}-{1186Lb}, a planet that failed to hide},
	abstract = {Using the gravitational microlensing event OGLE-2014-BLG-1186 as instructive example, we present a new generic systematic approach for identifying the nature of localised deviations from single-lens point-source light curves, which ensures that 1) the claimed signal is substantially above the noise ﬂoor, 2) the inferred properties are robustly determined and their estimation not subject to confusion with systematic noise in the photometry, 3) there are no alternative viable solutions within the model framework that might have been missed. Assessing the photometric noise by means of an eﬀective model signiﬁcantly increases the sensitivity of the total microlensing data set to more subtle perturbations, and thereby in particular to low-mass planets. For OGLE-2014-BLG-1186, we were able to consistently separate the eﬀects of parallax and lens binarity, leading to a robust measurement of the respective model parameters. We ﬁnd a planet of mass M2 = (54 ± 10) M⊕, orbiting a star of mass M1 = (0.41 ± 0.07) M , located at a distance DL = (1.5 ± 0.2) kpc from Earth, independent of any assumptions of the kinematics and mass distribution of the Milky Way or stellar or planetary mass functions. While the event time-scale of tE = (264 ± 17) d seems very long, making OGLE-2014-BLG-1186 a particular event lasting for four years, there is nothing obviously suspicious about the event or our interpretation. Our ﬁndings rather further strengthen the point that a larger than originally assumed fraction of planet-hosting microlensing lens stars resides in the Galactic disk, and moreover calls for a careful comparison of microlensing results with Milky Way models that take the speciﬁc structure of the spiral arms into account.},

However, the presence of extended caustics, and the fact that the images of the source star cannot be determined analytically while their number depends on the source position (relative to the lens system), makes such a task difﬁcult in general. Combining the advantages of several earlier approaches, an adaptive contouring algorithm is presented, which only relies on a small number of simple rules and operations on the adaptive search grid. By using the parametric representation of critical curves and caustics found by Erdl \& Schneider, seed solutions to the adaptive grid are found, which ensures that no images or holes are missed.},

	abstract = {We employ VLTI GRAVITY to resolve, for the ﬁrst time, the two images generated by a gravitational microlens. The measurements of the image separation θ−,+ = 3.78 ± 0.05 mas, and hence the Einstein radius θE = 1.87 ± 0.03 mas, are precise. This demonstrates the robustness of the method, provided that the source is bright enough for GRAVITY (K 10.5) and the image separation is of order or larger than the fringe spacing. When θE is combined with a measurement of the “microlens parallax” πE, the two will together yield the lens mass and lens-source relative parallax and proper motion. Because the source parallax and proper motion are well measured by Gaia, this means that the lens characteristics will be fully determined, whether or not it proves to be luminous. This method can be a powerful probe of dark, isolated objects, which are otherwise quite diﬃcult to identify, much less characterize. Our measurement contradicts Einstein’s (1936) prediction that “the luminous circle [i.e., microlensed image] cannot be distinguished” from a star.},

These time series are usually modelled using a parametric and/or physical model that assumes independent and homoscedastic errors, but in many cases, these assumptions are not accurate and there remains a temporal dependence structure on the errors. This can occur, for example, when the proposed model cannot explain all the variability of the data or when the parameters of the model are not properly estimated. In this work, we deﬁne an autoregressive model for irregular discrete-time series based on the discrete time representation of the continuous autoregressive model of order 1. We show that the model is ergodic and stationary. We further propose a maximum likelihood estimation procedure and assess the ﬁnite sample performance by Monte Carlo simulations. We implement the model on real and simulated data from Gaussian as well as other distributions, showing that the model can ﬂexibly adapt to different data distributions. We apply the irregular autoregressive model to the residuals of a transit of an extrasolar planet to illustrate errors that remain with temporal structure. We also apply this model to residuals of an harmonic ﬁt of light curves from variable stars to illustrate how the model can be used to detect incorrect parameter estimation.},

We investigate orbital shrinkage by the combined effects of secular perturbations from a distant companion star (Kozai oscillations) and tidal friction. We integrate the relevant equations of motion to predict the distribution of orbital elements produced by this process. Binary stars with orbital periods of 0.1Y10 days, with a median of \$2 days, are produced from binaries with much longer periods (10 to \$105 days), consistent with observations indicating that most or all short-period binaries have distant companions (tertiaries). We also make two new testable predictions: (1) For periods between 3 and 10 days, the distribution of the mutual inclination between the inner binary and the tertiary orbit should peak strongly near 40  and 140 . (2) Extrasolar planets whose host stars have a distant binary companion may also undergo this process, in which case the orbit of the resulting hot Jupiter will typically be misaligned with the equator of its host star.},

Instead of considering separate ﬁts with diﬀerent number of planets, we use a birth-death Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to infer the posterior distribution for the number of planets in a single run. In a natural way, the marginal distributions for the orbital parameters of all planets are also inferred. This method is applied to HARPS data of CoRoT-7. We conﬁdently recover the orbits of both CoRoT-7b and CoRoT-7c although the data show evidence for the presence of additional signals.},

From the frequency of these oscillations we determine the mass of Aldebaran to be \$1.16 {\textbackslash}pm 0.07 {\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, and note that this implies its planet will have been subject to insolation comparable to the Earth for some of the star's main sequence lifetime. Our approach to sparse, irregularly sampled time series astronomical observations has the potential to unlock asteroseismic measurements for thousands of stars in archival data, and push to lower-mass planets around red giant stars.},

Though designed for evenly spaced time series, moderately irregular cadences can be treated as evenly-spaced time series with missing data. Fitting algorithms are eﬃcient and software implementations are widely available. We apply ARIMA models to light curves of four variable stars, discussing their eﬀectiveness for diﬀerent temporal characteristics. A variety of extensions to ARIMA are outlined, with emphasis on recently developed continuous-time models like CARMA and CARFIMA designed for irregularly spaced time series.

	abstract = {During its two year prime mission the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will perform a time-series photometric survey covering over 80\% of the sky. This survey comprises observations of 26 24◦ × 96◦ sectors that are each monitored continuously for approximately 27 days. The main goal of TESS is to ﬁnd transiting planets around 200,000 pre-selected stars for which ﬁxed aperture photometry is recorded every two minutes. However, TESS is also recording and delivering FullFrame Images (FFIs) of each detector at a 30 minute cadence. We have created an open-source tool, eleanor, to produce light curves for objects in the TESS FFIs. Here, we describe the methods used in eleanor to produce light curves that are optimized for planet searches. The tool performs background subtraction, aperture and PSF photometry, decorrelation of instrument systematics, and cotrending using principal component analysis. We recover known transiting exoplanets in the FFIs to validate the pipeline and perform a limited search for new planet candidates in Sector 1. Our tests indicate that eleanor produces light curves with signiﬁcantly less scatter than other tools that have been used in the literature. Cadence-stacked images, and raw and detrended eleanor light curves for each analyzed star will be hosted on MAST, with planet candidates on ExoFOP-TESS as Community TESS Objects of Interest (CTOIs). This work conﬁrms the promise that the TESS FFIs will enable the detection of thousands of new exoplanets and a broad range of time domain astrophysics.},

Reaching these ambitious goals will require further improvements in instrumentation and new analysis tools.

We provide a basic description of how each of these techniques works and discuss forefront developments that will result in new discoveries.

	abstract = {We outline a mechanism that explains the observed lack of circumbinary planets (CBPs) via coupled stellar-tidal evolution of isolated binary stars. Tidal forces between low-mass, short-period binary stars on the pre-main sequence slow the stellar rotations, transferring rotational angular momentum to the orbit as the stars approach the tidally locked state. This transfer increases the binary orbital period, expanding the region of dynamical instability around the binary, and destabilizing CBPs that tend to preferentially orbit just beyond the initial dynamical stability limit. After the stars tidally lock, we ﬁnd that angular momentum loss due to magnetic braking can signiﬁcantly shrink the binary orbit, and hence the region of dynamical stability, over time impacting where surviving CBPs are observed relative to the boundary. We perform simulations over a wide range of parameter space and ﬁnd that the expansion of the instability region occurs for most plausible initial conditions and that in some cases, the stability semi-major axis doubles from its initial value. We examine the dynamical and observable consequences of a CBP falling within the dynamical instability limit by running N-body simulations of circumbinary planetary systems and ﬁnd that typically, at least one planet is ejected from the system. We apply our theory to the shortest period Kepler binary that possesses a CBP, Kepler-47, and ﬁnd that its existence is consistent with our model. Under conservative assumptions, we ﬁnd that coupled stellar-tidal evolution of pre-main sequence binary stars removes at least one close-in CBP in 87\% of multi-planet circumbinary systems.},

To address this deﬁciency, we perform a fully automated search for long-period exoplanets with only one or two transits in the archival Kepler light curves. When applied to the ∼40,000 brightest Sun-like target stars, this search produces 16 long-period exoplanet candidates. Of these candidates, six are novel discoveries and ﬁve are in systems with inner short-period transiting planets. Since our method involves no human intervention, we empirically characterize the detection efﬁciency of our search. Based on these results, we measure the average occurrence rate of exoplanets smaller than Jupiter with orbital periods in the range 2–25years to be 2.0±0.7 planets per Sun-like star.},

Gaussian processes (GPs) are a popular class of models used for this purpose, but since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to small data sets. In this paper, we present a novel method for GPs modeling in one dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly with the size of the data set. We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical time series data sets. These demonstrations are examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically driven damped harmonic oscillators—providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice—but we also demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing scalable GP methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

	abstract = {No true extrasolar Earth analog is known. Hundreds of planets have been found around Sun-like stars that are either Earth-sized but on shorter periods, or else on year-long orbits but somewhat larger. Under strong assumptions, exoplanet catalogs have been used to make an extrapolated estimate of the rate at which Sun-like stars host Earth analogs. These studies are complicated by the fact that every catalog is censored by non-trivial selection effects and detection efﬁciencies, and every property (period, radius, etc.) is measured noisily. Here we present a general hierarchical probabilistic framework for making justiﬁed inferences about the population of exoplanets, taking into account survey completeness and, for the ﬁrst time, observational uncertainties. We are able to make fewer assumptions about the distribution than previous studies; we only require that the occurrence rate density be a smooth function of period and radius (employing a Gaussian process). By applying our method to synthetic catalogs, we demonstrate that it produces more accurate estimates of the whole population than standard procedures based on weighting by inverse detection efﬁciency. We apply the method to an existing catalog of small planet candidates around G dwarf stars. We conﬁrm a previous result that the radius distribution changes slope near Earth’s radius. We ﬁnd that the rate density of Earth analogs is about 0.02 (per star per natural logarithmic bin in period and radius) with large uncertainty. This number is much smaller than previous estimates made with the same data but stronger assumptions.},

	abstract = {We develop and apply a model to quantify the global eﬃciency of radial orbit migration among stars in the Milky Way disk. This model parameterizes the possible star formation and enrichment histories, radial birth proﬁles, and combines them with a migration model that relates present-day orbital radii to birth radii through a Gaussian probability, broadening with age τ as σRM8 τ /8Gyr. Guided by observations, we assume that stars are born with an initially tight age–metallicity relation at given radius, which becomes subsequently scrambled by radial orbit migration, thereby providing a direct observational constraint on radial orbit migration strength σRM8. We ﬁt this model with MCMC to the observed age–metallicity distribution of low-α red clump stars with Galactocentric radii between 5 and 14 kpc from APOGEE DR12, sidestepping the complex spatial selection function and accounting for the considerable age uncertainties. This simple model reproduces well the observed data, and we ﬁnd a global (in radius and time) radial orbit migration eﬃciency in the Milky Way of σRM8 = 3.6 ± 0.1 kpc when marginalizing over all other model aspects. This shows that radial orbit migration in the Milky Way’s main disk is indeed rather strong, in line with theoretical expectations: stars migrate by about a half-mass radius over the age of the disk. The model ﬁnds the Sun’s birth radius at ∼ 5.2 kpc. If such strong radial orbit migration is typical, this mechanism plays indeed an important role in setting the structural regularity of disk galaxies.},

The prior is weakly informative and penalises complexity by shrinking the range towards inﬁnity and the marginal variance towards zero.

Here, we note that the impact of all of these effects on planet formation is qualitatively altered if the circumbinary disk structure is layered, with a non-turbulent midplane layer (dead zone) and strongly turbulent surface layers. For close binaries, we ﬁnd that the dead zone typically extends from a radius close to the inner disk edge up to a radius of around 10–20 AU from the center of mass of the binary. The peak in the surface density occurs within the dead zone, far from the inner disk edge, close to the snow line, and may act as a trap for aerodynamically coupled solids. We suggest that circumbinary planet formation may be easier near this preferential location than for disks around single stars. However, dead zones around wide binaries are less likely, and hence planet formation may be more difﬁcult there.},

We demonstrate hierarchical inference for such models with a method that accounts for uncertainties in each binary merger's individual parameters, for mass-dependent selection effects, and also for the presence of a second population of candidate events caused by detector noise. Thus, the method is robust to potential biases from a contaminated sample and allows us to extract information from events that have a relatively small probability of astrophysical origin.},

The magniﬁcation from such microlensing results in rapid brightness ﬂuctuations which reveal not only the properties of the lensing masses, but also the surface brightness distribution in the source. However, while the combination of deﬂections due to individual stars is linear, the resulting magniﬁcations are highly non-linear, leading to signiﬁcant computational challenges which currently limit the range of problems which can be tackled. This paper presents a new and novel implementation of a numerical approach to gravitational microlensing, increasing the scale of the problems that can be tackled by more than two orders of magnitude, opening up a new regime of astrophysically interesting problems.},

Rather, planets are discovered by their gravitational perturbation of light from a more distant source. I review the fundamental concepts of microlensing planet searches and discuss their practical application. I show how the strengths and peculiarities of the method ﬂow from the basic manner in which planets are discovered. In particular, microlensing is sensitive to very low-mass planets on wide orbits and free-ﬂoating planets, and can be used to search for planets orbiting host stars with a broad range of masses and Galactocentric distances. However, microlensing events are rare and cannot be predicted in advance, the majority of the host stars are extremely faint, and the planetary signals typically last less than a day. These strengths motivate microlensing searches as powerful, complementary probes of unexplored parameter space that have already provided important constraints on the demographics of planets beyond the “snow line.” However, the realworld challenges associated with the practical application of the method have driven the organization and evolution of the microlensing ﬁeld and will continue to drive future developments from next-generation ground-based experiments through possible future space-based missions.},

	abstract = {Microlensing is increasingly gaining recognition as a powerful method for the detection and characterization of extrasolar planetary systems. Naively, one might expect that the probability of detecting the inﬂuence of more than one planet on any single microlensing light curve would be small. Recently, however, Griest \& Saﬁzadeh have shown that, for a subset of events, those with minimum-impact parameter umin Շ 0.1 (high-magniﬁcation events), the detection probability is nearly 100\% for Jovian-mass planets with projected separations in the range 0.6–1.6 of the primary Einstein ring radius RE and remains substantial outside this zone. In this Letter, we point out that this result implies that, regardless of orientation, all Jovian-mass planets with separations near 0.6–1.6RE dramatically affect the central region of the magniﬁcation pattern and thus have a signiﬁcant probability of being detected (or ruled out) in high-magniﬁcation events. The joint probability, averaged over all inclinations and phases, of two planets having projected separations within 0.6–1.6RE is substantial: 1\%–15\% for two planets with the intrinsic separations of Jupiter and Saturn orbiting around 0.3–1.0 M, parent stars. We illustrate by example the complicated magniﬁcation patterns and light curves that can result when two planets are present, and we discuss the possible implications of our result on detection efﬁciencies and the ability to discriminate between multiple and single planets in high-magniﬁcation events.},

	abstract = {Gravitational wave astronomy has set in motion a scientific revolution. To further enhance the science reach of this emergent field, there is a pressing need to increase the depth and speed of the gravitational wave algorithms that have enabled these groundbreaking discoveries. To contribute to this effort, we introduce Deep Filtering, a new highly scalable method for end-to-end time-series signal processing, based on a system of two deep convolutional neural networks, which we designed for classification and regression to rapidly detect and estimate parameters of signals in highly noisy time-series data streams. We demonstrate a novel training scheme with gradually increasing noise levels, and a transfer learning procedure between the two networks. We showcase the application of this method for the detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Our results indicate that Deep Filtering significantly outperforms conventional machine learning techniques, achieves similar performance compared to matched-filtering while being several orders of magnitude faster thus allowing real-time processing of raw big data with minimal resources. More importantly, Deep Filtering extends the range of gravitational wave signals that can be detected with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. This framework leverages recent advances in artificial intelligence algorithms and emerging hardware architectures, such as deep-learning-optimized GPUs, to facilitate real-time searches of gravitational wave sources and their electromagnetic and astro-particle counterparts.},

	abstract = {Time series photometry and spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets allow us to study their atmospheres. Unfortunately, the required precision to extract atmospheric information surpasses the design speciﬁcations of most general purpose instrumentation, resulting in instrumental systematics in the light curves that are typically larger than the target precision. Systematics must therefore be modelled, leaving the inference of light-curve parameters conditioned on the subjective choice of systematics models and model selection criteria. This paper aims to test the reliability of the most commonly used deterministic systematics models and model selection criteria. As we are primarily interested in recovering light-curve parameters rather than the favoured systematics model, marginalization over systematics models is introduced as a more robust alternative than simple model selection. This can incorporate uncertainties in the choice of systematics model into the error budget as well as the model parameters. Its use is demonstrated using a series of simulated transit light curves. Stochastic models, speciﬁcally Gaussian processes, are also discussed in the context of marginalization over systematics models, and are found to reliably recover the transit parameters for a wide range of systematics functions. None of the tested model selection criteria – including the Bayesian information criterion – routinely recovered the correct model. This means that commonly used methods that are based on simple model selection may underestimate the uncertainties when extracting transmission and eclipse spectra from real data, and low signiﬁcance claims using such techniques should be treated with caution. In general, no systematics modelling techniques are perfect; however, marginalization over many systematics models helps to mitigate poor model selection, and stochastic processes provide an even more ﬂexible approach to modelling instrumental systematics.},

Observations have shown that free-ﬂoating Jupiter-mass objects can exceed the number of stars in our galaxy, implying that capture scenarios may not be so rare. To address this issue, we construct a three-dimensional simulation of a three-body scattering between a free-ﬂoating planet and a star accompanied by a Jupiter-mass bound planet. We distinguish between three diﬀerent possible scattering outcomes, where the free-ﬂoating planet may get captured after the interaction with the binary, remain unbound, or “kick-out” the bound planet and replace it. The simulation was performed for diﬀerent masses of the free-ﬂoating planets and stars, as well as diﬀerent impact parameters, inclination angles and approach velocities. The outcome statistics are used to construct an analytical approximation of the cross section for capturing a free-ﬂoating planet by ﬁtting their dependence on the tested variables. The analytically approximated cross section is used to predict the capture rate for these kinds of objects, and to estimate that about 1\% of all stars are expected to experience a temporary capture of a free-ﬂoating planet during their lifetime. Finally, we propose additional physical processes that may increase the capture statistics and whose contribution should be considered in future simulations.},

	abstract = {We present a new three-dimensional map of dust reddening, based on Gaia parallaxes and stellar photometry from Pan-STARRS 1 and 2MASS. This map covers the sky north of a declination of −30◦, out to a distance of several kiloparsecs. This new map contains three major improvements over our previous work. First, the inclusion of Gaia parallaxes dramatically improves distance estimates to nearby stars. Second, we incorporate a spatial prior that correlates the dust density across nearby sightlines. This produces a smoother map, with more isotropic clouds and smaller distance uncertainties, particularly to clouds within the nearest kiloparsec. Third, we infer the dust density with a distance resolution that is four times ﬁner than in our previous work, to accommodate the improvements in signal-to-noise enabled by the other improvements. As part of this work, we infer the distances, reddenings and types of 799 million stars. We obtain typical reddening uncertainties that are ∼30\% smaller than those reported in the Gaia DR2 catalog, reﬂecting the greater number of photometric passbands that enter into our analysis.

This goal is typically accomplished by dividing the task in two: collecting data (observing), and constructing models to represent that data (theorizing). Owing to the natural tendency for specialization, a disconnect can develop between the best available theories and the best available data, potentially delaying advances in our understanding new classes of transients. We introduce MOSFiT: the Modular Open-Source Fitter for Transients, a Python-based package that downloads transient datasets from open online catalogs (e.g., the Open Supernova Catalog), generates Monte Carlo ensembles of semianalytical light curve ﬁts to those datasets and their associated Bayesian parameter posteriors, and optionally delivers the ﬁtting results back to those same catalogs to make them available to the rest of the community. MOSFiT is designed to help bridge the gap between observations and theory in time-domain astronomy; in addition to making the application of existing models and creation of new models as simple as possible, MOSFiT yields statistically robust predictions for transient characteristics, with a standard output format that includes all the setup information necessary to reproduce a given result. As large-scale surveys such as LSST discover entirely new classes of transients, tools such as MOSFiT will be critical for enabling rapid comparison of models against data in statistically consistent, reproducible, and scientiﬁcally beneﬁcial ways.},

Results. We spatially separate all the building blocks of the IRAS 08544-4431 system in our milliarcsecond-resolution image. Our dissection reveals a dust sublimation front that is strikingly similar to that expected in early-stage protoplanetary disks, as well as an unexpected ﬂux signal of ∼4\% from the secondary star. The energy output from this companion indicates the presence of a compact circum-companion accretion disk, which is likely the origin of the fast outﬂow detected in Hα.
Conclusions. Our image provides the most detailed view into the heart of a dusty circumstellar disk to date. Our results demonstrate that binary evolution processes and circumstellar disk evolution can be studied in detail in space and over time.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3328},
	abstract = {A survey of currently known planet-hosting stars indicates that approximately 25\% of extrasolar planetary systems are within dual-star environments. Several of these systems contain stellar companions on moderately close orbits, implying that studies of the formation and dynamical evolution of giant and terrestrial planets, in and around binary star systems have now found realistic grounds. With the recent launch of the space telescope CoRoT, and the launch of NASA’s Kepler satellite in 2009, the number of such dynamically complex systems will soon increase and many more of their diverse and interesting dynamical characteristics will soon be discovered. It is therefore, both timely and necessary, to obtain a deep understanding of the history and current status of research on planets in binary star systems. This chapter will serve this purpose by reviewing the models of the formation of giant and terrestrial planets in dual-star environments, and by presenting results of the studies of their dynamical evolution and habitability, as well as the mechanisms of delivery of water and other volatiles to their terrestrial-class objects. In this chapter, the reader is presented with a comprehensive, yet relatively less technical approach to the study of planets in and around binary stars, and with discussions on the diﬀerences between dynamical characteristics of these systems and planetary systems around single stars.},

	abstract = {Transiting circumbinary planets are more easily detected around short-period than long-period binaries, but none have yet been observed by Kepler orbiting binaries with periods shorter than seven days. In triple systems, secular Kozai–Lidov cycles and tidal friction (KLCTF) have been shown to reduce the inner orbital period from ∼104 to a few days. Indeed, the majority of short-period binaries are observed to possess a third stellar companion. Using secular evolution analysis and population synthesis, we show that KLCTF makes it unlikely for circumbinary transiting planets to exist around short-period binaries. We ﬁnd the following outcomes. (1) Sufﬁciently massive planets in tight and/or coplanar orbits around the inner binary can quench the KL evolution because they induce precession in the inner binary. The KLCTF process does not take place, preventing the formation of a short-period binary. (2) Secular evolution is not quenched and it drives the planetary orbit into a high eccentricity, giving rise to an unstable conﬁguration, in which the planet is most likely ejected from the system. (3) Secular evolution is not quenched but the planet survives the KLCTF evolution. Its orbit is likely to be much wider than the currently observed inner binary orbit, and is likely to be eccentric and inclined with respect to the inner binary. These outcomes lead to two main conclusions: (1) it is unlikely to ﬁnd a massive planet on a tight and coplanar orbit around a short-period binary, and (2) the properties of circumbinary planets in short-period binaries are constrained by secular evolution.},

The event light curve is characterized by a brief (∼ 3 days) anomaly near the peak produced by minor-image perturbations. From modeling, we ﬁnd two distinct solutions that describe the observed light curve almost equally well. From the investigation of the lens-system conﬁgurations, we ﬁnd that the confusion in the lensing solution is caused by the degeneracy between the two solutions resulting from the source passages on different sides of the planetary caustic. These degeneracies can be severe for major-image perturbations but it is known that they are considerably less severe for minor-image perturbations. From the comparison of the lens-system conﬁguration with those of two previously discovered planetary events, for which similar degeneracies were reported, we ﬁnd that the degeneracies are caused by the special source trajectories that passed the star-planet axes at approximately right angles. By conducting a Bayesian analysis, it is estimated that the lens is a planetary system in iawnhmdiicavhsidsauMaglhida=negt0e.p1nl5aen−+ra00e..tt20e88wsMoitlh⊙ut.aioHmnesar.sesTthMheeppp=rloa0nje.e6ct2tem−+d10a..31hs36soeMsst-Jipn(l0aa.nn6ed5t −+so01e..u32pt51aoMraf tJti)hoeinsspoaarrrbeeintaitn⊥hge∼saes0lo.r9we5p-rmaeusaesansntdMth∼-ed1wm.a0ar5sfsaehusosfftoorrwttihhthee two solutions.

	abstract = {We report the discovery of the microlensing planet OGLE-2018-BLG-0740Lb. The planet is detected with a very strong signal of ∆χ2 ∼ 4630, but the interpretation of the signal suffers from two types of degeneracies. One type is caused by the previously known close/wide degeneracy, and the other is caused by an ambiguity between two solutions, in which one solution requires to incorporate ﬁnite-source effects, while the other solution is consistent with a point-source interpretation. Although difﬁcult to be ﬁrmly resolved based on only the photometric data, the degeneracy is resolved in strong favor of the point-source solution with the additional external information obtained from astrometric and spectroscopic observations. The small astrometric offset between the source and baseline object supports that the blend is the lens and this interpretation is further secured by the consistency of the spectroscopic distance estimate of the blend with the lensing parameters of the point-source solution. The estimated mass of the host is 1.0 ± 0.1 M⊙ and the mass of the planet is 4.5 ± 0.6 MJ (close solution) or 4.8 ± 0.6 MJ (wide solution) and the lens is located at a distance of 3.2 ± 0.5 kpc. The bright nature of the lens, with I ∼ 17.1 (V ∼ 18.2), combined with its dominance of the observed ﬂux suggest that radial-velocity (RV) follow-up observations of the lens can be done using high-resolution spectrometers mounted on large telescopes, e.g., VLT/ESPRESSO, and this can potentially not only measure the period and eccentricity of the planet but also probe for close-in planets. We estimate that the expected RV amplitude would be ∼ 60 sin i m s−1.},

We here present the ALMA detection of ﬂux at 1.3 mm from NN Ser, which is likely due to thermal emission from a dust disc of mass ∼0.8 ± 0.2 M⊕. We performed simulations of the history of NN Ser to determine possible origins of this dust, and conclude that the most likely origin is, in fact, common-envelope material which was not expelled from the system and instead formed a circumbinary disc. These discs have been predicted by theory but previously remained undetected. While the presence of this dust does not prove the existence of planets around NN Ser, it adds credibility to the possibility of planets forming from common-envelope material in a ‘second-generation’ scenario.},

This is relevant when the covariance matrix cannot be calculated directly. The compression is especially valuable when the covariance matrix varies with the model parameters. In this case, it may be prohibitively expensive to run enough simulations to estimate the full covariance matrix throughout the parameter space. This compression may be particularly valuable for the next-generation of weak lensing surveys, such as proposed for Euclid and LSST, for which the number of summary data (such as band power or shear correlation estimates) is very large, ∼ 104, due to the large number of tomographic redshift bins that the data will be divided into. In the pessimistic case where the covariance matrix is estimated separately for all points in an MCMC analysis, this may require an unfeasible 109 simulations. We show here that MOPED can reduce this number by a factor of 1000, or a factor of ∼ 106 if some regularity in the covariance matrix is assumed, reducing the number of simulations required to a manageable 103, making an otherwise intractable analysis feasible.},

Unlike in standard nested sampling more accurate results can be obtained by continuing the calculation for longer.

Without appropriate settings, however, nested sampling software may fail to explore such posteriors fully; for example producing correlated samples or missing signiﬁcant modes. This paper introduces new diagnostic tests to assess the reliability of both parameter estimation and evidence calculations using nested sampling software, and demonstrates them empirically. We present two new diagnostic plots for nested sampling, and give practical advice for nested sampling software users. Our diagnostic tests and diagrams are implemented in nestcheck1: a publicly available python package for analysing nested sampling calculations which is compatible with results from MultiNest and PolyChord.},

	abstract = {Astronomers are often confronted with funky populations and distributions of objects: brighter objects are more likely to be detected; targets are selected based on colour cuts; imperfect classiﬁcation yields impure samples. Failing to account for these eﬀects leads to biased analyses. In this paper we present a simple overview of a Bayesian consideration of sample selection, giving solutions to both analytically tractable and intractable models. This is accomplished via a combination of analytic approximations and Monte Carlo integration, in which dataset simulation is eﬃciently used to correct for issues in the observed dataset. This methodology is also applicable for data truncation, such as requiring densities to be strictly positive. Toy models are included for demonstration, along with discussions of numerical considerations and how to optimise for implementation. We provide sample code to demonstrate the techniques. The methods in this paper should be widely applicable in ﬁelds beyond astronomy, wherever sample selection eﬀects occur.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05794},
	abstract = {The microlensing parallax campaign with the Spitzer space telescope aims to measure masses and distances of microlensing events seen towards the Galactic bulge, with a focus on planetary microlensing events. The hope is to measure how the distribution of planets depends on position within the Galaxy. In this paper, we compare 50 microlens parallax measurements from 2015 Spitzer campaign to three diﬀerent Galactic models commonly used in microlensing analyses, and we ﬁnd that ≥ 80 \% of these events have microlensing parallax values higher than the medians predicted by Galactic models. We use the Anderson-Darling (AD) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests on the cumulative distributions of the Bayesian prior probability that the each of the Spitzer parallax measurements is at least as large as the observed microlensing parallax values. These tests indicate probabilities of pAD {\textless} 3.0 × 10−8 and pKS {\textless} 4.1 × 10−6 that the data are consistent with these Galactic models from the AD and KS tests respectively. Given that many Spitzer light curves show evidence of large correlated errors, we conclude that this discrepancy is probably due to systematic errors in the Spitzer photometry. Since the 2015 sample is composed of single lens events, this discrepancy cannot be explained as a selection eﬀect, as might be the case if we were considering a sample of planetary or binary microlensing events. We consider a simple scheme to correct for this problem by multiplying the reported error bars on the Spitzer microlensing parallax measurements by a constant factor, and we ﬁnd that an error bar renormalization factor of 3.4 provides reasonable agreement with all three Galactic models. We expect, however, that corrections to the uncertainties in the Spitzer photometry itself are likely to be a more eﬀective way to address the systematic errors. We also argue that is important to include the πE prior distributions when analyzing events with large uncertainties or degeneracies in πE measurements.},

In addition, juliet allows to ﬁt transiting and non-transiting multi-planetary systems, and to ﬁt GPs which might share hyperparameters between the photometry and radial-velocities simultaneously (e.g., stellar rotation periods), which might be useful for disentangling stellar activity in radial-velocity measurements. Nested Sampling, Importance Nested Sampling and Dynamic Nested Sampling is performed with publicly available codes which in turn give juliet multi-threading options, allowing it to scale the computing time of complicated multi-dimensional problems.

We combine binary star evolution models with dynamical simulations to study the orbital evolution of these planets as their hosts undergo common-envelope (CE) stages, losing in the process a tremendous amount of mass on dynamical timescales. Five of the systems experience at least one Roche-lobe overﬂow and CE stage(Kepler-1647 experiences three), and the binary stars either shrink to very short orbits or coalesce; two systems trigger a double-degenerate supernova explosion. Kepler’s circumbinary planets predominantly remain gravitationally bound at the end of the CE phase, migrate to larger orbits, and may gain signiﬁcant eccentricity; their orbital expansion can be more than an order of magnitude and can occur over the course of a single planetary orbit. The orbits these planets can reach are qualitatively consistent with those of the currently known post-CE, eclipse-time variations circumbinary candidates. Our results also show that circumbinary planets can experience both modes of orbital expansion (adiabatic and nonadiabatic) if their host binaries undergo more than one CE stage; multiplanet circumbinary systems like Kepler-47 can experience both modes during the same CE stage. Additionally, unlike Mercury orbiting the Sun, a circumbinary planet with the same semimajor axis can survive the CE evolution of a close binary star with a total mass of 1 M.},

The formation pathway for these planets is complicated by uncertainties in the formation mechanism of the host stars. In this paper, we compare the dynamical states of single- and binary-star planetary systems. Speciﬁcally, we pose two questions: (1) What does it mean for a circumbinary system to be dynamically packed? (2) How many systems are required to differentiate between a population of packed or sparse planets? We determine when circumbinary systems become dynamically unstable as a function of the separation between the host-stars and the inner planet, and the ﬁrst and second planets. We show that these represent unique stability constraints compared to single-star systems. We ﬁnd that although the existing Kepler data is insufﬁcient to distinguish between a population of packed or sparse circumbinary systems, a more thorough study of circumbinary Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) combined with an order of magnitude increase in the number of systems may prove conclusive. Future space missions such as TESS provide the best opportunity for increasing the sample size.},

	abstract = {We present the analysis of the event OGLE-2017-BLG-1186 from the 2017 Spitzer microlensing campaign. This event is remarkable because its source is photometrically variable. We perform an asteroseismic analysis of the source star and ﬁnd that it is an oscillating red giant with average timescale of ∼ 9 days. The asteroseismic analysis also provides us source properties including the source angular size (∼ 27 µas) and distance (∼ 11.5 kpc), which are essential for inferring the properties of the lens. When ﬁtting the light curve, we test the feasibility of Gaussian Processes (GPs) in handling the correlated noise caused by the variable source. We ﬁnd, in this event, that the GP model cannot provide better constraints on the parameters of interest because of the worse estimation of blending ﬂuxes compared to the traditional χ2 minimization method. We note that this event is the ﬁrst microlensing system for which asteroseismology and GPs have been used to account for the variable source. With both ﬁnite-source eﬀect and microlens parallax measured, we ﬁnd that the lens is likely a ∼ 0.045 M brown dwarf at distance ∼ 9.0 kpc, or a ∼ 0.073 M ultracool dwarf at distance ∼ 9.8 kpc. Combining the estimated lens properties with a Bayesian analysis using a Galactic model, we ﬁnd a ∼ 35\% probability for the lens to be a bulge object and ∼ 65\% to be a background disk object.},

	abstract = {Studying newly discovered circumbinary planetary systems improves our understanding of planetary system formation. Learning the architectural properties of these systems is essential for constraining the different formation mechanisms. We ﬁrst revisit the stability limit of circumbinary planets. Next, we focus on eclipsing stellar binaries and obtain an analytical expression for the transit probability in a realistic setting, where a ﬁnite observation period and planetary orbital precession are included. Our understanding of the architectural properties of the currently observed transiting systems is then reﬁned, based on Bayesian analysis and a series of tested hypotheses. We ﬁnd that (1) it is not a selection bias that the innermost planets reside near the stability limit for eight of the nine observed systems, and this pile-up is consistent with a log uniform distribution of the planetary semimajor axis; (2) it is not a selection bias that the planetary and stellar orbits are nearly coplanar (3°), and this —along with previous studies—may imply an occurrence rate of circumbinary planets similar to that of single star systems; (3) the dominance of observed circumbinary systems with only one transiting planet may be caused by selection effects; (4) formation mechanisms involving Lidov–Kozai oscillations, which may produce misalignment and large separation between planets and stellar binaries, are consistent with the lack of transiting circumbinary planets around short-period stellar binaries, in agreement with previous studies. As a consequence of (4), eclipse timing variations may better suit the detection of planets in such conﬁgurations.},

The statistics literature contains two distinct sets of tools, those based on information theory such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and those on Bayesian inference such as the Bayesian evidence and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The Deviance Information Criterion combines ideas from both heritages; it is readily computed from Monte Carlo posterior samples and, unlike the AIC and BIC, allows for parameter degeneracy. I describe the properties of the information criteria, and as an example compute them from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 3-yr data for several cosmological models.

	abstract = {Extended source eﬀects can be seen in gravitational lensing events when sources cross critical lines. Those events probe the stellar intensity proﬁle and could be used to measure limb darkening coeﬃcients to test stellar model predictions. A data base of accurately measured stellar proﬁles will be needed to correctly subtract the stellar ﬂux in planetary transient events. The amount of data that is being and will be produced in current and future microlensing surveys, from the space and the ground, requires algorithms that can quickly compute light curves for diﬀerent source-lens conﬁgurations. Based on the convolution method we describe a general formalism to compute those curves for single lenses. We develop approximations in terms of quadratures of elliptic integrals that we integrate by solving the associated ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations. We construct analytic solutions for a limb darkening and, for the ﬁrst time, for a parabolic proﬁle that are accurate at the ∼ 1 − 3\% and 0.5\% level, respectively. These solutions can be computed orders of magnitude faster than other integration routines. They can be implemented in pipelines processing large data sets to extract stellar parameters in real time.},

Elevated impact velocities and orbit crossings from eccentricity oscillations are the primary contributors to high energy, potentially destructive collisions that inhibit the growth of aspiring planets. In this work, we conduct high-resolution, inter-particle gravity enabled N-body simulations to investigate the feasibility of planetesimal growth in the Kepler-34 system. We improve upon previous work by including planetesimal disk self-gravity and an extensive collision model to accurately handle inter-planetesimal interactions. We ﬁnd that super-catastrophic erosion events are the dominant mechanism up to and including the orbital radius of Kepler-34(AB)b, making in situ growth unlikely. It is more plausible that Kepler-34(AB)b migrated from a region beyond 1.5 AU. Based on the conclusions that we have made for Kepler-34, it seems likely that all of the currently known circumbinary planets have also migrated signiﬁcantly from their formation location with the possible exception of Kepler-47(AB)c.},

	abstract = {We describe work in progress by a collaboration of astronomers and statisticians developing a suite of Bayesian data analysis tools for extrasolar planet (exoplanet) detection, planetary orbit estimation, and adaptive scheduling of observations. Our work addresses analysis of stellar reﬂex motion data, where a planet is detected by observing the “wobble” of its host star as it responds to the gravitational tug of the orbiting planet. Newtonian mechanics speciﬁes an analytical model for the resulting time series, but it is strongly nonlinear, yielding complex, multimodal likelihood functions; it is even more complex when multiple planets are present. The parameter spaces range in size from few-dimensional to dozens of dimensions, depending on the number of planets in the system, and the type of motion measured (line-of-sight velocity, or position on the sky). Since orbits are periodic, Bayesian generalizations of periodogram methods facilitate the analysis. This relies on the model being linearly separable, enabling partial analytical marginalization, reducing the dimension of the parameter space. Subsequent analysis uses adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and adaptive importance sampling to perform the integrals required for both inference (planet detection and orbit measurement), and information-maximizing sequential design (for adaptive scheduling of observations). We present an overview of our current techniques and highlight directions being explored by ongoing research.},

EVEREST employs a variant of pixel level decorrelation to remove systematics introduced by the spacecraft’s pointing error and a Gaussian process to capture astrophysical variability. We apply EVEREST to all K2 targets in campaigns 0–7, yielding light curves with precision comparable to that of the original Kepler mission for stars brighter than Kp » 13, and within a factor of two of the Kepler precision for fainter targets. We perform cross-validation and transit injection and recovery tests to validate the pipeline, and compare our light curves to the other de-trended light curves available for download at the MAST High Level Science Products archive. We ﬁnd that EVEREST achieves the highest average precision of any of these pipelines for unsaturated K2 stars. The improved precision of these light curves will aid in exoplanet detection and characterization, investigations of stellar variability, asteroseismology, and other photometric studies. The EVEREST pipeline can also easily be applied to future surveys, such as the TESS mission, to correct for instrumental systematics and enable the detection of low signal-to-noise transiting exoplanets.

We also modify PLD to work for saturated stars and improve its performance on extremely variable stars. On average, EVEREST 2.0 light curves have 10–20\% higher photometric precision than those in the previous version, yielding the highest precision light curves at all Kp magnitudes of any publicly available K2 catalog. For most K2 campaigns, we recover the original Kepler precision to at least Kp = 14, and to at least Kp = 15 for campaigns 1, 5, and 6.

All light curves for campaigns 0–8 are available online in the EVEREST catalog, which will be continuously updated with future campaigns.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11136},
	abstract = {The target of many astronomical studies is the recovery of tiny astrophysical signals living in a sea of uninteresting (but usually dominant) noise. In many contexts (i.e., stellar time-series, or high-contrast imaging, or stellar spectroscopy), there are structured components in this noise caused by systematic effects in the astronomical source, the atmosphere, the telescope, or the detector. More often than not, evaluation of the true physical model for these nuisances is computationally intractable and dependent on too many (unknown) parameters to allow rigorous probabilistic inference. Sometimes, housekeeping data---and often the science data themselves---can be used as predictors of the systematic noise. Linear combinations of simple functions of these predictors are often used as computationally tractable models that can capture the nuisances. These models can be used to fit and subtract systematics prior to investigation of the signals of interest, or they can be used in a simultaneous fit of the systematics and the signals. In this Note, we show that if a Gaussian prior is placed on the weights of the linear components, the weights can be marginalized out with an operation in pure linear algebra, which can (often) be made fast. We illustrate this model by demonstrating the applicability of a linear model for the non-linear systematics in K2 time-series data, where the dominant noise source for many stars is spacecraft motion and variability.},

Results. Our main recommendation is to always treat the derivation of (astro-)physical parameters from astrometric data, in particular when parallaxes are involved, as an inference problem which should preferably be handled with a full Bayesian approach.
Conclusions. Gaia will provide fundamental data for many ﬁelds of astronomy. Further data releases will provide more data, and more precise data. Nevertheless, to fully use the potential it will always be necessary to pay careful attention to the statistical treatment of parallaxes and proper motions. The purpose of this paper is to help astronomers ﬁnd the correct approach.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03944},
	abstract = {The use of machine learning is becoming ubiquitous in astronomy, but remains rare in the study of the atmospheres of exoplanets. Given the spectrum of an exoplanetary atmosphere, a multi-parameter space is swept through in real time to find the best-fit model. Known as atmospheric retrieval, it is a technique that originates from the Earth and planetary sciences. Such methods are very time-consuming and by necessity there is a compromise between physical and chemical realism versus computational feasibility. Machine learning has previously been used to determine which molecules to include in the model, but the retrieval itself was still performed using standard methods. Here, we report an adaptation of the random forest method of supervised machine learning, trained on a pre-computed grid of atmospheric models, which retrieves full posterior distributions of the abundances of molecules and the cloud opacity. The use of a pre-computed grid allows a large part of the computational burden to be shifted offline. We demonstrate our technique on a transmission spectrum of the hot gas-giant exoplanet WASP-12b using a five-parameter model (temperature, a constant cloud opacity and the volume mixing ratios or relative abundance by number of water, ammonia and hydrogen cyanide). We obtain results consistent with the standard nested-sampling retrieval method. Additionally, we can estimate the sensitivity of the measured spectrum to constraining the model parameters and we can quantify the information content of the spectrum. Our method can be straightforwardly applied using more sophisticated atmospheric models and also to interpreting an ensemble of spectra without having to retrain the random forest.},

The planetary model survives the test with ﬂying colours, correctly predicting a progressive lag in eclipse times of 36 s that has set in since 2010 compared to the previous 8 yr of precise times. Allowing both orbits to be eccentric, we ﬁnd orbital periods of 7.9 ± 0.5 and 15.3 ± 0.3 yr, and masses of 2.3 ± 0.5 and 7.3 ± 0.3 MJ. We also ﬁnd dynamically long-lived orbits consistent with the data, associated with 2:1 and 5:2 period ratios. The data scatter by 0.07 s relative to the best-ﬁtting model, by some margin the most precise of any of the proposed eclipsing compact object planet hosts. Despite the high precision, degeneracy in the orbit ﬁts prevents a signiﬁcant measurement of a period change of the binary and of N-body effects. Finally, we point out a major ﬂaw with a previous dynamical stability analysis of NN Ser, and by extension, with a number of analyses of similar systems.},

In this follow-up paper to Martin \& Triaud (2015), the time-dependence is probed deeper by analytically calculating when and for how long the binary and planet orbits overlap, allowing for transits to occur. The derived equations are applied to the known transiting circumbinary planets found by Kepler to predict when future transits will occur, and whether they will be observable by upcoming space telescopes TESS, CHEOPS and PLATO. The majority of these planets spend less than 50 per cent of their time in a transiting conﬁguration, some less than 20 per cent. From this it is calculated that the known Kepler eclipsing binaries likely host an additional ∼17–30 circumbinary planets that are similar to the 10 published discoveries, and they will ultimately transit someday, potentially during the TESS and PLATO surveys.},

	abstract = {Transits on single stars are rare. The probability rarely exceeds a few per cent. Furthermore, this probability rapidly approaches zero at increasing orbital period. Therefore, transit surveys have been predominantly limited to the inner parts of exoplanetary systems. Here, we demonstrate how circumbinary planets allow us to beat these unfavourable odds. By incorporating the geometry and the three-body dynamics of circumbinary systems, we analytically derive the probability of transitability, a conﬁguration where the binary and planet orbits overlap on the sky. We later show that this is equivalent to the transit probability, but at an unspeciﬁed point in time. This probability, at its minimum, is always higher than for single star cases. In addition, it is an increasing function with mutual inclination. By applying our analytical development to eclipsing binaries, we deduce that transits are highly probable, and in some case guaranteed. For example, a circumbinary planet revolving at 1 au around a 0.3 au eclipsing binary is certain to eventually transit – a 100 per cent probability – if its mutual inclination is greater than 0◦.6. We show that the transit probability is generally only a weak function of the planet’s orbital period; circumbinary planets may be used as practical tools for probing the outer regions of exoplanetary systems to search for and detect warm to cold transiting planets.},

The companions have masses of 22−+75 MJup (Kepler-448c) and 150−+6400 MJup (Kepler-693c), and both are on eccentric orbits (e = 0.65+−00..1039 for Kepler-448c and e = 0.47−+00..1016 for Kepler-693c) with periastron distances of 1.5 au. Moderate eccentricities are detected for the inner orbits as well (e = 0.34+−00..0087 for Kepler-448b and e = 0.2+−00..21 for Kepler-693b). In the Kepler-693 system, a large mutual inclination between the inner and outer orbits (53−+79 deg or 134+−1110 deg) is also revealed by the TDVs. This is likely to induce a secular oscillation of the inner WJ’s eccentricity that brings its periastron close enough to the host star for tidal star–planet interactions to be signiﬁcant. In the Kepler-448 system, the mutual inclination is weakly constrained and such an eccentricity oscillation is possible for a fraction of the solutions. Thus these WJs may be undergoing tidal migration to become hot Jupiters (HJs), although the migration via this process from beyond the snow line is disfavored by the close-in and massive nature of the companions. This may indicate that WJs can be formed in situ and could even evolve into HJs via high-eccentricity migration inside the snow line.},

This will produce an apparent maximum deviation of the source position of 2.8 ± 0.1 mas. In the most propitious circumstance, Gaia will be able to determine the mass of LAWD 37 to ∼3 per cent.

For candidate 2, the lens (l2) is a metal-poor M dwarf with mass ≈ 0.38M derived from SED ﬁtting, and maximum ampliﬁcation of 10−+4100 mmag occurs on June 3rd 2019 (±4d). This permits a new algorithm for mass inference on the microlens. Given the predicted time, the photometric lightcurve of these events can be densely sampled by ground-based telescopes. The lightcurve is a function of the unknown lens mass, together with 8 other parameters for all of which Gaia provides measurements and uncertainties. Leveraging this prior information on the source and lens provided by Gaia’s astrometric solution, and assuming that a ground-based campaign can provide 50 measurements at mmag precision, we show for example that the mass of l1 can be recovered to within 20 per cent (68 per cent conﬁdence limit).},

The number of planets with optical phase curve detections, however, is currently too small to study them as an aggregate population, motivating an extension of the search to non-transiting planets. Here we present an algorithm for the detection of non-transiting, short-period giant planets in the Kepler ﬁeld. The procedure uses the phase curves themselves as evidence for the planets’ existence. We employ a supervised learning algorithm to recognize the salient time-dependent properties of synthetic phase curves; we then search for detections of signals that match these properties. After demonstrating the algorithm’s capabilities, we classify 142,630 FGK Kepler stars without conﬁrmed planets or KOIs and, for each one, assign a probability of a phase curve of a non-transiting planet being present. We identify 60 high-probability non-transiting hot Jupiter candidates. We also derive constraints on the candidates’ albedos and oﬀsets of the phase curve maxima. These targets are strong candidates for follow-up radial velocity conﬁrmation and characterization. Once conﬁrmed, the atmospheric information content in the phase curves may be studied in yet greater detail.},

The lens system could be a planetary system with a very low mass host, around the brown dwarf/planetary mass boundary, or a brown dwarf binary. We found two competing models that explain the observed light curves with companion/host mass ratios of q ∼ 0.01 and ∼ 0.17, respectively. From the measurement of ﬁnite source eﬀects in the best-ﬁt planetary model, we ﬁnd a relatively small angular Einstein radius of θE ≃ 0.03 mas which favors a low mass lens. We conduct a Bayesian analysis to obtain the probability distribution of the lens properties. The results for the planetary models strongly depend on the minimum mass, Mmin, in the assumed mass function. In summary, there are two solutions of the lens system: (1) a brown dwarf/planetary mass boundary object orbited by a super-Neptune (the planetary model with Mmin = 0.001M⊙) and (2) a brown dwarf binary (the binary model). If the planetary models is correct, this system can be one of a new class of planetary system, having a low host mass and also a planetary mass ratio (q {\textless} 0.03) between the host and its companion. The discovery of the event is important for the study of planetary formation in very low mass objects. In addition, it is important to consider all viable solutions in these kinds of ambiguous events in order for the future comprehensive statistical analyses of planetary/binary microlensing events.},

	abstract = {We present and apply Gaussbock, a new embarrassingly parallel iterative algorithm for cosmological parameter estimation designed for an era of cheap parallel computing resources. Gaussbock uses Bayesian nonparametrics and truncated importance sampling to accurately draw samples from posterior distributions with an orders-of-magnitude speed-up in wall time over alternative methods. Contemporary problems in this area often suﬀer from both increased computational costs due to highdimensional parameter spaces and consequent excessive time requirements, as well as the need for ﬁne tuning of proposal distributions or sampling parameters. Gaussbock is designed speciﬁcally with these issues in mind. We explore and validate the performance and convergence of the algorithm on a fast approximation to the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 (DES Y1) posterior, ﬁnding reasonable scaling behavior with the number of parameters. We then test on the full DES Y1 posterior using large-scale supercomputing facilities, and recover reasonable agreement with previous chains, although the algorithm can underestimate the tails of poorly-constrained parameters. In addition, we provide the community with a user-friendly software tool for accelerated cosmological parameter estimation based on the methodology described in this paper.},

	abstract = {The chaotic nature of planet dynamics in the solar system suggests the relevance of a statistical approach to planetary orbits. In such a statistical description, the time-dependent position and velocity of the planets are replaced by the probability density function (PDF) of their orbital elements. It is quite natural to set up this kind of approach in the framework of statistical mechanics. In the present paper I focus on the collisionless excitation of eccentricities and inclinations by gravitational interactions in a planetary system, the prototype of such a dynamics being the future planet trajectories in the solar system. I thus address the statistical mechanics of the planetary orbits in the solar system and try to reproduce the PDFs numerically constructed by Laskar (2008). I show that the microcanonical ensemble of the Laplace-Lagrange theory accurately reproduce the statistics of the giant planet orbits. To model the inner planets I then investigate the ansatz of equiprobability in the phase space constrained by the secular integrals of motion. The eccentricity and inclination PDFs of Earth and Venus are reproduced with no free parameters. Within the limitations of a stationary model, the predictions also show a reasonable agreement with Mars PDFs and that of Mercury inclination. The eccentricity of Mercury demands in contrast a deeper analysis. I ﬁnally revisit Laskar’s random walk approach to the time dependence of the inner planet PDFs. Such a statistical theory could be combined with direct numerical simulations of planet trajectories in the context of planet formation, which is likely to be a chaotic process.},

	abstract = {We introduce SuperNNova, an open source supernova photometric classiﬁcation framework which leverages recent advances in Deep Neural Networks. Our core algorithm is a recurrent neural network (RNN) that is trained to classify light-curves using photometric information only. Additional information such as host-galaxy redshift can be incorporated to improve performance. We evaluate our framework using realistic supernovae simulations that include survey detection. We show that our method, for the type Ia vs. non Ia supernovae classiﬁcation problem, reaches accuracies greater than 96.51 ± 0.12 without any redshift information and up to 99.51 ± 0.08 when redshift, either photometric or spectroscopic, is available. Further, we show that our method attains unprecedented performance for classiﬁcation of incomplete light-curves, reaching accuracies {\textgreater} 84.02±0.21 ({\textgreater} 92.21±0.81) without host-galaxy redshift (with redshift information) two days before maximum light. In contrast with previous methods, there is no need for time-consuming feature engineering and we show that our method scales to very large datasets with a modest computing budget. In addition, we investigate often neglected pitfalls of machine learning algorithms. We show that commonly used algorithms suﬀer from poor calibration and overconﬁdence on out-of-distribution samples when applied to supernovae data. We devise extensive tests to estimate the robustness of classiﬁers and cast the learning procedure under a Bayesian light, demonstrating a much better handling of uncertainties. We study the beneﬁts of Bayesian RNNs for SN Ia cosmology. Our code is open-sourced on GitHub .},

Often, RV observations are obtained until a particular fractional precision on the inferred mass is achieved. I show that when the decision to stop collecting RV observations depends on the mass inferred from already-collected data, this will bias mass measurements upward, particularly when the fixed length of RV observing campaigns is considered. I suggest that observing teams should determine their observing strategy for each star before any data are collected, and all stopping criteria should not directly depend on the inferred mass. Observing teams should explicitly publish both their criteria for observing targets and deciding to end their observations, as well as their mass non-detections to avoid introducing biases into the masses---and thus inferences on the densities, compositions, and atmospheres---of transiting planets.},

All published microlensing events attributed to unbound planets were identiﬁed based on their short timescale (below 2 d), but lacked an angular Einstein radius measurement (and hence lacked a signiﬁcant constraint on the lens mass). Here we present the discovery of a Neptune-mass free-ﬂoating planet candidate in the ultrashort (tE = 0.320 ± 0.003 d) microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-1540. The event exhibited strong ﬁnite source eﬀects, which allowed us to measure its angular Einstein radius of θE = 9.2 ± 0.5 µas. There remains, however, a degeneracy between the lens mass and distance. The combination of the source proper motion and source-lens relative proper motion measurements favors a Neptune-mass lens located in the Galactic disk. However, we cannot rule out that the lens is a Saturn-mass object belonging to the bulge population. We exclude stellar companions up to ∼ 15 au. Owing to the relatively large relative lens-source proper motion, any stellar companions should be detectable using the high-resolution imaging in the relatively near future.},

Under standard assumptions about binary evolution, we ﬁnd that survival of the planets through the entire main-sequence lifetime is very unlikely. Hence, we conclude that the planets are not survivors from before the common envelope phase, implying that either they formed recently out of material ejected from the primary or that the observed signals are of non-planetary origin.},

	abstract = {We study how close-in systems such as those detected by Kepler are affected by the dynamics of bodies in the outer system. We consider two scenarios: outer systems of giant planets potentially unstable to planet–planet scattering, and wide binaries that may be capable of driving Kozai or other secular variations of outer planets’ eccentricities. Dynamical excitation of planets in the outer system reduces the multiplicity of Kepler-detectable planets in the inner system in ∼ 20 − 25\% of our systems. Accounting for the occurrence rates of wide-orbit planets and binary stars, ≈ 18\% of close-in systems could be destabilised by their outer companions in this way. This provides some contribution to the apparent excess of systems with a single transiting planet compared to multiple; however, it only contributes at most 25\% of the excess. The effects of the outer dynamics can generate systems similar to Kepler-56 (two coplanar planets signiﬁcantly misaligned with the host star) and Kepler-108 (two signiﬁcantly noncoplanar planets in a binary). We also identify three pathways to the formation of eccentric warm Jupiters resulting from the interaction between outer and inner systems: direct inelastic collision between an eccentric outer and an inner planet; secular eccentricity oscillations that may “freeze out” when scattering resolves in the outer system; and scattering in the inner system followed by “uplift”, where inner planets are removed by interaction with the outer planets. In these scenarios, the formation of eccentric warm Jupiters is a signature of a past history of violent dynamics among massive planets beyond ∼ 1 au.},

	abstract = {We study the stability of systems of three giant planets orbiting 3–8 M stars at orbital distances of {\textgreater}10 au as the host star ages through the main sequence (MS) and well into the white dwarf (WD) stage. Systems are stable on the MS if the planets are separated by more than ∼9 Hill radii. Most systems surviving the MS will remain stable until the WD phase, although planets scattered on to small pericentres in unstable systems can be swallowed by the expanding stellar envelope when the star ascends the giant branches. Mass-loss at the end of the asymptotic giant branch triggers delayed instability in many systems, leading to instabilities typically occurring at WD cooling ages of a few 100 Myr. This instability occurs both in systems that survived the star’s previous evolution unscathed, and in systems that previously underwent scattering instabilities. The outcome of such instability around WDs is overwhelmingly the ejection of one of the planets from the system, with several times more ejections occurring during the WD phase than during the MS. Furthermore, few planets are scattered close to the WD, just outside the Roche limit, where they can be tidally circularized. Hence, we predict that planets in WD systems rarely dynamically evolve to become ‘hot Jupiters’. Nor does it appear that the observed frequency of metal pollution in WD atmospheres can be entirely explained by planetesimals being destabilized following instability in systems of multiple giant planets, although further work incorporating low-mass planets and planetesimals is needed.},

We report 83 new eclipse timings that not only ﬁll in the gaps in those already published but also extend the time span of the (O–C) diagram by three years. Based on the archival and our new data spanning over more than 17 years, we re-examined the up-to-date system (O–C). The data revealed asystematic, quasi-sinusoidal variation deviating from an older linear ephemeris by about 100s. It also exhibits a maximum in the (O–C) near JD 2,456,400 that was previously unknown. We consider two most credible explanations of the (O–C) variability: the light propagation time due to the presence of an invisible companion in a distant circumbinary orbit, and magnetic cycles reshaping one of the binary components, known as the Applegate or Lanza–Rodonó effect. We found that the latter mechanism is unlikely due to the insufﬁcient energy budget of the M-dwarf secondary. In the framework of the third-body hypothesis, we obtained meaningful constraints on the Keplerian parameters of a putative companion and its mass. Our best-ﬁtting model indicates that the observed quasi-periodic (O–C) variability can be explained by the presence of a brown dwarf with the minimal mass of 15 Jupiter masses rather than a planet, orbiting the binary in a moderately elliptical orbit (e  0.175) with a period of ∼10 years. Our analysis rules out thetwo-planetmodelproposed earlier.},

In this comment, I discuss some of these issues from a scientiﬁc perspective. What goal does model selection serve when all models are 6 known to be systematically wrong? How might “toy problems” tell a misleading story? How does the scientiﬁc goal of explanation align with (or diﬀer from) traditional statistical concerns?

	abstract = {We present results from a data challenge posed to the radial velocity (RV) community: namely, to quantify the “evidence” for n = \{0, 1, 2, 3\} planets in a set of synthetically generated RV datasets containing a range of planet signals. Participating teams were provided the same likelihood function and set of priors to use in their analysis. They applied a variety of methods to estimate Z, the marginal likelihood for each n-planet model, including cross-validation, the Laplace approximation, importance sampling, and nested sampling. We found the dispersion in Z across diﬀerent methods grew with increasing n-planet models: ∼ 3 for 0-planets, ∼ 10 for 1-planet, ∼ 102-103 for 2-planets, and {\textgreater} 104 for 3-planets. Most internal estimates of uncertainty in Z for individual methods signiﬁcantly underestimated the observed dispersion across all methods. Methods that adopted a Monte Carlo approach by comparing estimates from multiple runs yielded plausible uncertainties. Finally, two classes of numerical algorithms (those based on importance and nested samplers) arrived at similar conclusions regarding the ratio of Zs for n and (n + 1)-planet models. One analytic method (the Laplace approximation) demonstrated comparable performance. We express both optimism and caution: we demonstrate that it is practical to perform rigorous Bayesian model comparison for ≤3-planet models, yet robust planet discoveries require researchers to better understand the uncertainty in Z and its connections to model selection. Future research should address greater n-planet models, RVs with stellar activity indicators, and many more simulated datasets with a wider range of planet and noise properties.},

The current searches, soon to be upgraded, will probably allow determination of the mass function of stars and brown dwarfs in the next few years; these efforts will also provide good statistical information about binary systems, in particular their mass ratios.

As it is shown, the presented formalism can be applied to ﬁnd optimal instants for radial velocity measurements in transiting explanatory systems to constrain the orbital eccentricity as well as to detect secular variations in the eccentricity or in the longitude of periastron.},

In this work, we analyze the light curves of two binary-lens events, OGLE-2006-BLG-277 and OGLE-2012-BLG-0031, for which the light curves exhibit strong deviations from standard models. From modeling considering various second-order effects, we ﬁnd that the deviations are mostly explained by the effect of the lens orbital motion. We also ﬁnd that lens parallax effects can mimic orbital effects to some extent. This implies that modeling light curves of binary-lens events not considering orbital effects can result in lens parallaxes that are substantially different from actual values and thus wrong determinations of physical lens parameters. This demonstrates the importance of routine consideration of orbital effects in interpreting light curves of binary-lens events. It is found that the lens of OGLE-2006-BLG-277 is a binary composed of a low-mass star and a brown dwarf companion.},

For planets with radii ∼ 1 − 6 R⊕ and periods {\textless} 100 days, we ﬁnd that, except for a normalization factor, the occurrence rate vs q can be described by the same broken power law with a break at ∼ 3 × 10−5 independent of host type for hosts below 1 M . These ﬁndings indicate that the planet-to-star mass ratio is a more fundamental quantity in planet formation than planet mass. We then compare our results to those from microlensing for which the overwhelming majority satisﬁes the Mhost {\textless} 1 M criterion. The break in q for the microlensing planet population, which mostly probes the region outside the snowline, is ∼3-10 times higher than that inferred from Kepler. Thus, the most common planet inside the snowline is ∼3-10 times less massive than the one outside. With rocky planets interior to gaseous planets, the Solar System broadly follows the combined massratio function inferred from Kepler and microlensing. However, the exoplanet population has a less extreme radial distribution of planetary masses than the Solar System. Establishing whether the mass-ratio function beyond the snowline is also host type independent will be crucial to build a comprehensive theory of planet formation.},

Manual interpretation of potential exoplanet candidates is labor intensive and subject to human error, the results of which are diﬃcult to quantify. Here we present a new method of detecting exoplanet candidates in large planetary search projects which, unlike current methods uses a neural network. Neural networks, also called “deep learning” or “deep nets”, are a state of the art machine learning technique designed to give a computer perception into a speciﬁc problem by training it to recognize patterns. Unlike past transit detection algorithms deep nets learn to recognize planet features instead of relying on hand-coded metrics that humans perceive as the most representative. Our deep learning algorithms are capable of detecting Earth-like exoplanets in noisy time-series data with 99\% accuracy compared to a 73\% accuracy using least-squares. For planet signals smaller than the noise we devise a method for ﬁnding periodic transits using a phase folding technique that yields a constraint when ﬁtting for the orbital period. Deep nets are highly generalizable allowing data to be evaluated from diﬀerent time series after interpolation. We validate our deep net on light curves from the Kepler mission and detect periodic transits similar to the true period without any model ﬁtting.},

The WFIRST mission was chosen as the top-priority large space mission of the 2010 astronomy and astrophysics decadal survey in order to achieve three primary goals: to study dark energy via a wide-ﬁeld imaging survey, to study exoplanets via a microlensing survey, and to enable a guest observer program. Here we assess the ability of the several WFIRST designs to achieve the goal of the microlensing survey to discover a large sample of cold, low-mass exoplanets with semimajor axes beyond roughly one AU, which are largely impossible to detect with any other technique. We present the results of a suite of simulations that span the full range of the proposed WFIRST architectures, from the original design envisioned by the decadal survey, to the current design, which utilizes a 2.4-m telescope donated to NASA. By studying such a broad range of architectures, we are able to determine the impact of design trades on the expected yields of detected exoplanets. In estimating the yields we take particular care to ensure that our assumed Galactic model predicts microlensing event rates that match observations, consider the impact that inaccuracies in the Galactic model might have on the yields, and ensure that numerical errors in lightcurve computations do not bias the yields for the smallest mass exoplanets. For the nominal baseline WFIRST design and a ﬁducial planet mass function, we predict that a total of ∼1400 bound exoplanets with mass greater than ∼0.1 M⊕ should be detected, including ∼200 with mass 3 M⊕. WFIRST should have sensitivity to planets with mass down to ∼0.02 M⊕, or roughly the mass of Ganymede.},

	abstract = {Planets are typically thought to form in protoplanetary disks left over from protostellar disk of their newly formed host star. However, an additional planetary formation route may exist in old evolved binary systems. In such systems stellar evolution could lead to the formation of symbiotic stars, where mass transferred from the expanding evolved star to its binary companion could form an accretion disk around it. Such a disk could provide the necessary environment for the formation of a second generation of planets in both circumstellar or circumbinary conﬁgurations. Pre-existing ﬁrst generation planets surviving the post-MS evolution of such systems may serve as seeds for, and/or interact with, the second generation planets, possibly forming atypical planetary systems. Second generation planetary systems should be typically found in white dwarf binary systems, and may show various observational signatures. Most notably, second generation planets could form in environment which are inaccessible, or less favorable, for ﬁrst generation planets. The orbital phase space available for the second generation planets could be forbidden (in terms of the system stability) to ﬁrst generation planets in the pre-evolved progenitor binaries. In addition planets could form in metal poor environments such as globular clusters and/or in double compact object binaries. Observations of planets in such forbidden or unfavorable regions may serve to uniquely identify their second generation character. Finally, we point out a few observed candidate second generation planetary systems, including PSR B1620-26 (in a globular cluster), Gl 86, HD 27442 and all of the currently observed circumbinary planet candidates. A second generation origin for these systems could naturally explain their unique conﬁgurations.},

Pre-existing ﬁrst generation planets surviving the post-MS evolution of such systems would be dynamically eﬀected by the mass loss in the systems and may also interact with the newly formed disk. Such planets and/or planetesimals may also serve as seeds for the formation of the second generation planets, and/or interact with them, possibly forming atypical planetary systems. Second generation planetary systems should be typically found in white dwarf binary systems, and may show various observational signatures. Most notably, second generation planets could form in environment which are inaccessible, or less favorable, for ﬁrst generation planets. The orbital phase space available for the second generation planets could be forbidden (in terms of the system stability) to ﬁrst generation planets in the pre-evolved progenitor binaries. In addition planets could form in metal poor environments such as globular clusters and/or in double compact object binaries. Observations of exo-planets in such forbidden or unfavorable regions could possibly serve to uniquely identify their second generation character. Finally, we point out a few observed candidate second generation planetary systems, including Gl 86, HD 27442 and all of the currently observed circumbinary planet candidates. A second generation origin for these systems could naturally explain their unique conﬁgurations.},

	abstract = {Previous studies of Kepler planets examined occurrence rates as a function of radius and period. Here, we present occurrence rates as a function of host star metallicity, planet radius, and orbital period, using the California-Kepler Survey (CKS) dataset. Our occurrence rates leverage the high-purity CKS planet catalog with precise planet radii and host star metallicities. Metallicity M is correlated with planet occurrence for some, but not all, planet sizes and orbital periods. We model the planetmetallicity correlation as df ∝ 10βM dM , where β characterizes the strength of this correlation. For warm super-Earths having orbital periods P = 10–100 days and radii RP = 1.0–1.7 R⊕, we observe no correlation, with β = −0.3−+00..22. Warm super-Earths may represent a population of planets that form with high eﬃciency, even in metal-poor disks. The occurrence of planets with larger sizes or shorter orbital periods is correlated with metallicity, and this correlation steepens with decreasing orbital period and increasing planet size. Hot Jupiters are strongly correlated with metallicity, β = +3.4+−00..98. While hot Jupiters are rare, occurring around 0.57+−00..1142\% of Sun-like stars, they constitute an island in the P -RP plane that is surrounded by a sea of still lower occurrence, suggesting a distinct formation pathway. High metallicities in protoplanetary disks may increase the mass of the largest rocky cores or the speed at which they are assembled, enhancing the production of planets larger than 1.7 R⊕. The association between high metallicity and short-period planets may reﬂect disk density proﬁles that facilitate inward migration of planets or higher rates of planet-planet scattering.},

	abstract = {The presence of a planetary system can shield a planetesimal disk from the secular gravitational perturbations due to distant outer massive objects (planets or stellar companions). As the host star evolves off the main sequence to become a white dwarf, these planets can be engulfed during the giant phase, triggering secular instabilities and leading to the tidal disruptions of small rocky bodies. These disrupted bodies can feed the white dwarfs with rocky material and possibly explain the high-metallicity material in their atmospheres. We illustrate how this mechanism can operate when the gravitational perturbations are due to the KL mechanism from a stellar binary companion, a process that is activated only after the planet has been removed/engulfed. We show that this mechanism can explain the observed accretion rates if: (1) the planetary engulfment happens rapidly compared to the secular timescale, which is generally the case for wide binaries ({\textgreater}100 au) and planetary engulfment during the asymptotic giant branch; (2) the planetesimal disk has a total mass of {\textasciitilde}10-4 - 10-2MÅ. We show that this new mechanism can provide a steady supply of material throughout the entire life of the white dwarfs for all cooling ages and can account for a large fraction (up to nearly half) of the observed polluted white dwarfs.},

Thus, we estimate the total stellar mass of the SMC of about 1.0 × 109 M under assumption that all microlensing events toward this galaxy are caused by self-lensing. We also calculate the expected event rates and estimate that future large-scale surveys, like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), will be able to detect up to a few dozen microlensing events in the SMC annually. If the planet frequency in the SMC is similar to that in the Milky Way, a few extragalactic planets can be detected over the course of the LSST survey, provided signiﬁcant changes in the SMC observing strategy are devised. A relatively small investment of LSST resources can give us a unique probe of the population of extragalactic exoplanets.},

	abstract = {Many photometric time-domain surveys are driven by speciﬁc goals, such as searches for supernovae or transiting exoplanets, which set the cadence with which ﬁelds are re-imaged. In the case of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), several sub-surveys are conducted in parallel, leading to non-uniform sampling over its ∼20,000 deg2 footprint. While the median 7.26 deg2 PTF ﬁeld has been imaged ∼40 times in the R band, ∼2300 deg2 have been observed {\textgreater}100 times. We use PTF data to study the trade off between searching for microlensing events in a survey whose footprint is much larger than that of typical microlensing searches, but with far-from-optimal time sampling. To examine the probability that microlensing events can be recovered in these data, we test statistics used on uniformly sampled data to identify variables and transients. We ﬁnd that the von Neumann ratio performs best for identifying simulated microlensing events in our data. We develop a selection method using this statistic and apply it to data from ﬁelds with {\textgreater}10 R-band observations, 1.1 × 109 light curves, uncovering three candidate microlensing events. We lack simultaneous, multi-color photometry to conﬁrm these as microlensing events. However, their number is consistent with predictions for the event rate in the PTF footprint over the survey’s three years of operations, as estimated from near-ﬁeld microlensing models. This work can help constrain all-sky event rate predictions and tests microlensing signal recovery in large data sets, which will be useful to future time-domain surveys, such as that planned with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

Although the above authors illustrate the many legitimate uses of these statistics, in some important cases it can be impossible to compute the correct false positive rate. For example, it has become common practice to use the LRT or the F-test to detect a line in a spectral model or a source above background despite the lack of certain required regularity conditions. (These applications were not originally suggested by Cash or by Bevington.) In these and other settings that involve testing a hypothesis that is on the boundary of the parameter space, contrary to common practice, the nominal  2 distribution for the LRT or the F-distribution for the F-test should not be used. In this paper, we characterize an important class of problems in which the LRT and the Ftest fail and illustrate this nonstandard behavior. We brieﬂy sketch several possible acceptable alternatives, focusing on Bayesian posterior predictive probability values. We present this method in some detail since it is a simple, robust, and intuitive approach. This alternative method is illustrated using the gamma-ray burst of 1997 May 8 (GRB 970508) to investigate the presence of an Fe K emission line during the initial phase of the observation. There are many legitimate uses of the LRT and the F-test in astrophysics, and even when these tests are inappropriate, there remain several statistical alternatives (e.g., judicious use of error bars and Bayes factors). Nevertheless, there are numerous cases of the inappropriate use of the LRT and similar tests in the literature, bringing substantive scientiﬁc results into question.},

We ﬁnd that the observed spacings are tightly clustered around 12 mutual Hill radii, when transit geometry and sensitivity limits are accounted for. In comparison, dynamical integrations reveal that the minimum spacing required for systems of similar masses to survive dynamical instability for as long as 1 billion yr is ∼10 if all orbits are circular and coplanar and ∼12 if planetary orbits have eccentricities of ∼0.02 (a value suggested by studies of planet transit-time variations). This apparent coincidence, between the observed spacing and the theoretical stability threshold, leads us to propose that typical planetary systems were formed with even tighter spacing, but most, except for the widest ones, have undergone dynamical instability, and are pared down to a more anemic version of their former selves, with fewer planets and larger spacings. So while the high-multiple systems (ﬁve or more transiting planets) are primordial systems that remain stable, the single or double planetary systems, abundantly discovered by the Kepler mission, may be the descendants of more closely packed high-multiple systems.

Planetesimal growth in disks around binaries has been expected to be inhibited interior to ∼10 AU by secular excitation of high relative velocities between planetesimals, leading to their collisional destruction (rather than agglomeration). Here we show that gravity of an axisymmetric gaseous circumbinary disk in which planets form drives fast precession of both the planetesimal and binary orbits, resulting in strong suppression of planetesimal eccentricities beyond 2–3 AU and making possible the growth of 1–102 km objects in this region. The precise location of the boundary of the accretion-friendly region depends on the size of the inner disk cavity cleared by the binary torques and on the disk mass (even 0.01 M disk strongly suppresses planetesimal excitation), among other things, but this zone does not extend to present orbits of Kepler circumbinary planets. The precession of the orbit of the central binary, enhanced by the mass concentration that is naturally present at the inner edge of a circumbinary disk, plays a key role in this suppression, which is a feature speciﬁc to the circumbinary planet formation.},

	abstract = {With several detections, the technique of gravitational microlensing has proven useful for studying planets that orbit stars at Galactic distances, and it can even be applied to detect planets in neighbouring galaxies. So far, planet detections by microlensing have been considered to result from a change in the bending of light and the resulting magniﬁcation caused by a planet around the foreground lens star. However, in complete analogy to the annual parallax effect caused by the revolution of the Earth around the Sun, the motion of the source star around the common barycentre with an orbiting planet can also lead to observable deviations in microlensing light curves that can provide evidence for the unseen companion. We discuss this effect in some detail and study the prospects of microlensing observations for revealing planets through this alternative detection channel. Given that small distances between lens and source star are favoured, and that the effect becomes nearly independent of the source distance, planets would remain detectable even if their host star is located outside the Milky Way with a sufﬁciently good photometry (exceeding present-day technology) being possible. From synthetic light curves arising from a Monte Carlo simulation, we ﬁnd that the chances for such detections are not overwhelming and appear practically limited to the most massive planets (at least with current observational set-ups), but they are large enough for leaving the possibility that one or the other signal has already been observed. However, it may remain undetermined whether the planet actually orbits the source star or rather the lens star, which leaves us with an ambiguity not only with respect to its location, but also to its properties.},

The new algorithm is conceptually simple, versatile and robust, and parallelizes trivially; it combines features of extant evolutionary algorithms with some novel ones, and fares well on the problem of ﬁtting binary-lens microlensing light curves, as well as on a number of other difﬁcult optimization problems. Success rates in excess of 90 per cent are achieved when ﬁtting synthetic though noisy binary-lens light curves, allowing no more than 20 min per ﬁt on a desktop computer; this success rate is shown to compare very favourably with that of both a conventional (iterated simplex) algorithm, and a more state-ofthe-art, artiﬁcial neural network based approach. As such, this work provides proof of concept for the use of an evolutionary algorithm as the basis for real-time, autonomous modelling of microlensing events. Further work is required to investigate how the algorithm will fare when faced with more complex and realistic microlensing modelling problems; it is, however, argued here that the use of parallel computing platforms, such as inexpensive graphics processing units, should allow ﬁtting times to be constrained to under an hour, even when dealing with complicated microlensing models. In any event, it is hoped that this work might stimulate some interest in evolutionary algorithms, and that the algorithm described here might prove useful for solving microlensing and/or more general model-ﬁtting problems.},

	abstract = {To date, the radial velocity (RV) method has been one of the most productive techniques for detecting and conﬁrming extrasolar planetary candidates. Unfortunately, stellar activity can induce RV variations which can drown out or even mimic planetary signals – and it is notoriously difﬁcult to model and thus mitigate the effects of these activity-induced nuisance signals. This is expected to be a major obstacle to using next-generation spectrographs to detect lower mass planets, planets with longer periods, and planets around more active stars. Enter Gaussian processes (GPs) which, we note, have a number of attractive features that make them very well suited to disentangling stellar activity signals from planetary signals. We present here a GP framework we developed to model RV time series jointly with ancillary activity indicators (e.g. bisector velocity spans, line widths, chromospheric activity indices), allowing the activity component of RV time series to be constrained and disentangled from e.g. planetary components. We discuss the mathematical details of our GP framework, and present results illustrating its encouraging performance on both synthetic and real RV data sets, including the publicly available Alpha Centauri B data set.},

It was found that the perturbations due to two-thirds of all planets occur in the time interval [−0.5tFWHM, 0.5tFWHM] with respect to the peak of the microlensing light curve, where tFWHM is typically ∼ 14 hours. This implies that only this restricted portion of the light curve need be intensively monitored for planets, a very signiﬁcant practical advantage. Nearly all planetary detections in high magniﬁcation events will not involve caustic crossings. We discuss the issues involved in determining the planetary parameters in high magniﬁcation events. Earth mass planets may be detected with 1-m class telescopes if their projected orbital radii lie within about 1.5 − 2.5 AU. Giant planets are detectable over a much larger region. For multiplanet systems the perturbations due to individual planets can be separated under certain conditions. The size of the source star needs to be determined independently, but the presence of spots on the source star is likely to be negligible, as is the eﬀect of planetary motion during an event.},

The systematic errors are kept well below machine precision, and long-term orbit integrations over 109 orbits show that IAS15 is optimal in the sense that it follows Brouwer’s law, i.e. the energy error behaves like a random walk. Our tests show that IAS15 is superior to a mixed-variable symplectic integrator and other popular integrators, including high-order ones, in both speed and accuracy. In fact, IAS15 preserves the symplecticity of Hamiltonian systems better than the commonly used nominally symplectic integrators to which we compared it. We provide an open-source implementation of IAS15. The package comes with several easy-to-extend examples involving resonant planetary systems, Kozai–Lidov cycles, close encounters, radiation pressure, quadrupole moment and generic damping functions that can, among other things, be used to simulate planet–disc interactions.

These allow for efﬁcient and reliable determinations of chaos indicators such as the Maximal Lyapunov characteristic Exponent (MLE) and the Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO). In this paper we lay out the theoretical framework to extend the idea of variational equations to higher order. We explicitly derive the differential equations that govern the evolution of second-order variations in the N-body problem. Going to second order opens the door to new applications, including optimization algorithms that require the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the solution, like the classical Newton’s method. Typically, these methods have faster convergence rates than derivative-free methods. Derivatives are also required for Riemann manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods which provide signiﬁcantly shorter correlation times than standard methods. Such improved optimization methods can be applied to anything from radial-velocity/transit-timing-variation ﬁtting to spacecraft trajectory optimization to asteroid deﬂection. We provide an implementation of ﬁrst- and second-order variational equations for the publicly available REBOUND integrator package. Our implementation allows the simultaneous integration of any number of ﬁrst- and second-order variational equations with the high-accuracy IAS15 integrator. We also provide routines to generate consistent and accurate initial conditions without the need for ﬁnite differencing.},

We also show that the tidal inﬂuence of Planet Nine can be discerned from that of smaller, nearer objects in the Kuiper belt. Moreover, ephemerides for all small solar system bodies observed in occultation could be signiﬁcantly improved using this network, thereby improving spacecraft navigation and reﬁning Solar System modeling.

	abstract = {The abundance and properties of planets orbiting binary stars – circumbinary planets – are largely unknown because they are difﬁcult to detect with currently available techniques. Results from the Kepler satellite and other studies indicate a minimum occurrence rate of circumbinary giant planets of ∼10 per cent, yet only a handful are presently known. Here, we study the potential of ESA’s Gaia mission to discover and characterize extrasolar planets orbiting nearby binary stars by detecting the binary’s periodic astrometric motion caused by the orbiting planet. We expect that Gaia will discover hundreds of giant planets around binaries with FGK-dwarf primaries within 200 pc of the Sun, if we assume that the giant planet mass distribution and abundance are similar around binaries and single stars. If on the other hand all circumbinary gas giants have masses lower than two Jupiter masses, we expect only four detections. Gaia is critically sensitive to the properties of giant circumbinary planets and will therefore make the detailed study of their population possible. Gaia’s precision is such that the distribution in mutual inclination between the binary and planetary orbital planes will be obtained. It also possesses the capacity to establish the frequency of planets across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, both as a function of mass and of stellar evolutionary state from pre-main sequence to stellar remnants. Gaia’s discoveries can reveal whether a second epoch of planetary formation occurs after the red giant phase.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03924},
	abstract = {We introduce a new class of sequential Monte Carlo methods called Nested Sampling via Sequential Monte Carlo (NS–SMC), which reframes the Nested Sampling method of Skilling (2006) in terms of sequential Monte Carlo techniques. This new framework allows one to obtain provably consistent estimates of marginal likelihood and posterior inferences when Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to produce new samples. An additional beneﬁt is that marginal likelihood estimates are also unbiased. In contrast to NS, the analysis of NS-SMC does not require the (unrealistic) assumption that the simulated samples be independent. As the original NS algorithm is a special case of NS–SMC, this provides insights as to why NS seems to produce accurate estimates despite a typical violation of its assumptions. For applications of NS-SMC, we give advice on tuning MCMC kernels in an automated manner via a preliminary pilot run, and present a new method for appropriately choosing the number of MCMC repeats at each iteration. Finally, a numerical study is conducted where the performance of NS–SMC and temperature–annealed SMC is compared on several challenging and realistic problems.

	abstract = {Historically, light curve studies of supernovae (SNe) and other transient classes have focused on individual objects with copious and high signal-to-noise observations. In the nascent era of wide ﬁeld transient searches, objects with detailed observations are decreasing as a fraction of the overall known SN population, and this strategy sacriﬁces the majority of the information contained in the data about the underlying population of transients. A population level modeling approach, simultaneously ﬁtting all available observations of objects in a transient sub-class of interest, fully mines the data to infer the properties of the population and avoids certain systematic biases. We present a novel hierarchical Bayesian statistical model for population level modeling of transient light curves, and discuss its implementation using an efﬁcient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo technique. As a test case, we apply this model to the Type IIP SN sample from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey, consisting of 18,837 photometric observations of 76 SNe, corresponding to a joint posterior distribution with 9176 parameters under our model. Our hierarchical model ﬁts provide improved constraints on light curve parameters relevant to the physical properties of their progenitor stars relative to modeling individual light curves alone. Moreover, we directly evaluate the probability for occurrence rates of unseen light curve characteristics from the model hyperparameters, addressing observational biases in survey methodology. We view this modeling framework as an unsupervised machine learning technique with the ability to maximize scientiﬁc returns from data to be collected by future wide ﬁeld transient searches like LSST.},

	abstract = {The orbits of two individual planets in two known binary star systems, γ Cephei and HD 196885 are numerically integrated using various numerical techniques to assess the chaotic or quasi-periodic nature of the dynamical system considered. The Hill stability (HS) function which measures the orbital perturbation of a planet around the primary star due to the secondary star is calculated for each system. The maximum Lyapunov exponent (MLE) time series are generated to measure the divergence/convergence rate of stable manifolds, which are used to diﬀerentiate between chaotic and nonchaotic orbits. Then, we calculate dynamical Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO) maps from solving the variational equations along with the equations of motion. These maps allow us to accurately diﬀerentiate between stable and unstable dynamical systems. The results obtained from the analysis of HS, MLE, and MEGNO maps are analysed for their dynamical variations and resemblance. The HS test for the planets shows stability and quasi-periodicity for at least ten million years. The MLE and the MEGNO maps have also indicated the local quasi-periodicity and global stability in a relatively short integration period. The orbital stability of the systems is tested using each indicator for various values of planet inclinations (ipl 25◦) and binary eccentricities. The reliability of HS criterion is also discussed based on its stability results compared with the MLE and MEGNO maps.},

	abstract = {Methods. We employed the Kashi \& Soker model to estimate the amount of mass that is retained during the ejection event and inferred the properties of the resulting disk from the conservation of mass and angular momentum. The resulting planetary masses were estimated from models with and without radiative feedback.
Results. We show that the observed planetary masses can be reproduced for appropriate model parameters. Photoheating can stabilize the disks in the interior, potentially explaining the observed planetary orbits on scales of a few AU. We compare the expected mass scale of planets for 11 additional systems with observational results and ﬁnd hints of two populations, one consistent with planet formation from the ejecta of common envelopes and the other a separate population that may have formed earlier.
Conclusions. The formation of the observed planets from the ejecta of common envelopes seems feasible. The model proposed here can be tested through reﬁned observations of additional post-common envelope systems. While it appears observationally challenging to distinguish between the accretion on pre-existing planets and their growth from new fragments, it may be possible to further constrain the properties of the protoplanetary disk through additional observations of current planetary candidates and post-common envelope binary systems.},

	abstract = {Started approximately in the late 1980s, exoplanetology has up to now unveiled the main gross bulk characteristics of planets and planetary systems. In the future it will benefit from more and more large telescopes and advanced space missions. These instruments will dramatically improve their performance in terms of photometric precision, detection speed, multipixel imaging, high-resolution spectroscopy, allowing to go much deeper in the knowledge of planets. Here we outline some science questions which should go beyond these standard improvements and how to address them. Our prejudice is that one is never too speculative: experience shows that the speculative predictions initially not accepted by the community have been confirmed several years later (like spectrophotometry of transits or circumbinary planets).},

	abstract = {Large sky surveys are increasingly relying on image subtraction pipelines for real-time (and archival) transient detection. In this process one has to contend with varying point-spread function (PSF) and small brightness variations in many sources, as well as artefacts resulting from saturated stars and, in general, matching errors. Very often the differencing is done with a reference image that is deeper than individual images and the attendant difference in noise characteristics can also lead to artefacts. We present here a deep-learning approach to transient detection that encapsulates all the steps of a traditional image-subtraction pipeline –image registration, background subtraction, noise removal, PSF matching and subtraction – in a single real-time convolutional network. Once trained, the method works lightening-fast and, given that it performs multiple steps in one go, the time saved and false positives eliminated for multi-CCD surveys like Zwicky Transient Facility and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will be immense, as millions of subtractions will be needed per night.},

	abstract = {The volume of data that will be produced by the next generation of astrophysical instruments represents a signiﬁcant opportunity for making unplanned and unexpected discoveries. Conversely, ﬁnding unexpected objects or phenomena within such large volumes of data presents a challenge that may best be solved using computational and statistical approaches. We present the application of a coarse-grained complexity measure for identifying interesting observations in large datasets. This measure, which has been termed apparent complexity, has been shown to model human intuition and perceptions of complexity. Apparent complexity provides a computationally eﬃcient alternative to supervised learning and traditional outlier detection methods for identifying the most interesting observations in very large datasets. Unlike supervised learning approaches it does not learn features associated with known interesting observations positioning the approach as a candidate for identifying unknown unknowns. Furthermore, the approach can be implemented at worst case linear time complexity, providing an advantage when processing very large datasets. We show using data from the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) that the approach can be used to distinguish between images of galaxies which have been classiﬁed as having simple and complex morphologies. We also show that the approach generalises well when applied to new data after being calibrated on a smaller dataset.},

The system is located at a distance of ∼5 kpc toward the Galactic Bulge. The event was observed by several ground-based groups as well as by Spitzer and Swift, allowing a measurement of the physical properties. However, the event is still subject to an eight-fold degeneracy, in particular the well-known close-wide degeneracy, and thus the projected separation between the two lens components is either ∼0.25 au or ∼45 au. This is the ﬁrst microlensing event observed by Swift, with the UVOT camera. We study the region of microlensing parameter space to which Swift is sensitive, ﬁnding that though Swift could not measure the microlens parallax with respect to ground-based observations for this event, it can be important for other events. Speciﬁcally, it is important for detecting nearby brown dwarfs and free-ﬂoating planets in high magniﬁcation events.},

Proper priors are deﬁned to penalise the complexity induced by deviating from the simpler base model and are formulated after the input of a user-deﬁned scaling parameter for that model component, both in the univariate and the multivariate case. These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeﬀreys’ priors, are designed to support Occam’s razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to deﬁne default prior distributions. Through examples and theoretical results, we demonstrate the appropriateness of this approach and how it can be applied in various situations.},

The method relies on sampling within a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the “nested” contours of likelihood, and not on the likelihood values.

This test is made possible by a conﬂuence of two relatively unusual circumstances. First, the binary lens is bright enough (I = 15.6) to permit Doppler measurements. Second, we measure not only the usual seven binary-lens parameters, but also the “microlens parallax” (which yields the binary mass) and two components of the instantaneous orbital velocity. Thus, we measure, effectively, six “Kepler+1” parameters (two instantaneous positions, two instantaneous velocities, the binary total mass, and the mass ratio). Since Doppler observations of the brighter binary component determine ﬁve Kepler parameters (period, velocity amplitude, eccentricity, phase, and position of periapsis), while the same spectroscopy yields the mass of the primary, the combined Doppler + microlensing observations would be overconstrained by 6 + (5 + 1) − (7 + 1) = 4 degrees of freedom. This makes possible an extremely strong test of the microlensing solution. We also introduce a uniform microlensing notation for single and binary lenses, deﬁne conventions, summarize all known microlensing degeneracies, and extend a set of parameters to describe full Keplerian motion of the binary lenses.},

	abstract = {Most stellar remnants so far have been found in binary systems, where they interact with matter from their companions. Isolated neutron stars and black holes are difﬁcult to ﬁnd as they are dark, yet they are predicted to exist in our Galaxy in vast numbers. We explored the OGLE-III data base of 150 million objects observed in years 2001–2009 and found 59 microlensing events exhibiting a parallax effect due to the Earth’s motion around the Sun. Combining parallax and brightness measurements from microlensing light curves with expected proper motions in the Milky Way, we identiﬁed 13 microlensing events which are consistent with having a white dwarf, neutron star or a black hole lens and we estimated their masses and distances. The most massive of our black hole candidates has 9.3 M and is at a distance of 2.4 kpc. The distribution of masses of our candidates indicates a continuum in mass distribution with no mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. We also present predictions on how such events will be observed by the astrometric Gaia mission.},

We show that while the planet-host system has an unambiguous microlens topology, there are two geometries within this topology that ﬁt the data equally well, which leads to a factor 2.5 diﬀerence in planet-host mass ratio, i.e., q = 1.5×10−3 versus q = 0.6 × 10−3. We show that this is an “accidental degeneracy” in the sense that it is due to a gap in the data. We dub it “the caustic-chirality degeneracy”. We trace the mathematical origins of this degeneracy, which should enable similar degenerate solutions to be easily located in the future. A Bayesian estimate, based on a Galactic model, yields a host mass M = 0.25−+00..1350M⊙ at a distance DL = 5.9+−11..935 kpc. The lens-source relative proper motion is relatively fast, µ = 9 mas yr−1, which implies that the host mass and distance can be determined by high-resolution imaging after about 10 years. The same observations could in principle resolve the discrete degeneracy in q, but this will be more challenging.},

	abstract = {To generate the standard microlensing light curve, we assume that the relative motion of the source, the lens and the observer is linear. In reality, the relative motion is likely to be more complicated due to accelerations of the observer, the lens and the source. The simplest approximation beyond the linear-motion assumption is to add a constant acceleration. Microlensing light curves due to accelerations can be symmetric or asymmetric depending on the angle between the acceleration and the velocity. We show that it is possible that some of the previously reported shorter marginal parallax events can be reproduced with constant-acceleration models, while the longer, multi-year parallax events are ill-ﬁtted by such models. We ﬁnd that there is a generic degeneracy inherent in constant-acceleration microlensing models. We also ﬁnd that there is an equivalent degeneracy in parallax models, which manifests itself in shortduration events. The importance of this new parallax degeneracy is illustrated with an example, using one of these marginal parallax events. Our new analysis suggests that another of these previously suspected parallax candidate events may be exhibiting some weak binary-source signatures. If this turns out to be true, spectroscopic observations of the source could determine some parameters in the model and may also constrain or even determine the lens mass. We also point out that symmetric light curves with constant accelerations can mimic blended light curves, producing misleading Einstein-radius crossing time-scales when ﬁtted by the standard ‘blended’ microlensing model; this may have some effect on the estimation of optical depth.},

	abstract = {Transiting circumbinary planets discovered by Kepler provide unique insight into binary star and planet formation. Several features of this new found population, for example the apparent pile-up of planets near the innermost stable orbit, may distinguish between formation theories. In this work, we determine how planet–planet scattering shapes planetary systems around binaries as compared to single stars. In particular, we look for signatures that arise due to differences in dynamical evolution in binary systems. We carry out a parameter study of N-body scattering simulations for four distinct planet populations around both binary and single stars. While binarity has little inﬂuence on the ﬁnal system multiplicity or orbital distribution, the presence of a binary dramatically affects the means by which planets are lost from the system. Most circumbinary planets are lost due to ejections rather than planet–planet or planet–star collisions. The most massive planet in the system tends to control the evolution. Systems similar to the only observed multiplanet circumbinary system, Kepler-47, can arise from much more tightly packed, unstable systems. Only extreme initial conditions introduce differences in the ﬁnal planet populations. Thus, we suggest that any intrinsic differences in the populations are imprinted by formation.},

A four-fold degeneracy is conﬁrmed in the light curves, similar to the close and wide degeneracy found in a double lens. Furthermore, we derive a set of equations for triple lens in the external shear approximation. By using these external shear equations, we identify two kinds of continuous degeneracies which may be confused double and triple lenses, i.e. the continuous external shear degeneracy among triple-lens systems and the double–triple lens degeneracy. These degeneracies are particularly important in high-magniﬁcation events, and thus, some caution needs to be applied when one infers the fraction of stars hosting multiple planets from microlensing. We study the dependence of the degeneracies on the lensing parameters (e.g. source trajectory) and give recipes about how the degeneracies should be explored with real data.},

By comparing the relative occurrences of multiple to single-transiting systems, recent analyses have revealed a signiﬁcant over-abundance of singles. Dubbed the “Kepler Dichotomy,” this feature has been interpreted as evidence for two separate populations of planetary systems: one where all orbits are conﬁned to a single plane, and a second where the constituent planetary orbits possess signiﬁcant mutual inclinations, allowing only a single member to be observed in transit at a given epoch. In this work, we demonstrate that stellar obliquity, excited within the disk-hosting stage, can explain this dichotomy. Young stars rotate rapidly, generating a signiﬁcant quadrupole moment, which torques the planetary orbits, with inner planets inﬂuenced more strongly. Given nominal parameters, this torque is sufﬁciently strong to excite signiﬁcant mutual inclinations between planets, enhancing the number of single-transiting planets, sometimes through a dynamical instability. Furthermore, as hot stars appear to possess systematically higher obliquities, we predict that single-transiting systems should be relatively more prevalent around more massive stars. We analyze the Kepler data and conﬁrm this signal to be present.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a path to hitherto unachievable differential photometric precisions from the ground, both in the optical and near-infrared (NIR), using custom-fabricated beam-shaping diffusers produced using specialized nanofabrication techniques. Such diffusers mold the focal plane image of a star into a broad and stable top-hat shape, minimizing photometric errors due to non-uniform pixel response, atmospheric seeing effects, imperfect guiding, and telescope-induced variable aberrations seen in defocusing. This PSF reshaping significantly increases the achievable dynamic range of our observations, increasing our observing efﬁciency and thus better averages over scintillation. Diffusers work in both collimated and converging beams. We present diffuser-assisted optical observations demonstrating 62+−1266ppm precision in 30 minute bins on a nearby bright star 16-Cygni A (V=5.95) using the ARC 3.5m telescope—within a factor of ∼2 of Kepler’s photometric precision on the same star. We also show a transit of WASP-85-Ab (V=11.2) and TRES-3b (V=12.4), where the residuals bin down to 180+−4616ppm in 30 minute bins for WASP-85-Ab—a factor of ∼4 of the precision achieved by the K2 mission on this target—and to 101ppm for TRES-3b. In the NIR, where diffusers may provide even more signiﬁcant improvements over the current state of the art, our preliminary tests have demonstrated 137+−6346ppm precision for a KS = 10.8 star on the 200" Hale Telescope. These photometric precisions match or surpass the expected photometric precisions of TESS for the same magnitude range. This technology is inexpensive, scalable, easily adaptable, and can have an important and immediate impact on the observations of transits and secondary eclipses of exoplanets.},

	abstract = {We compare the planet-to-star mass-ratio distribution measured by gravitational microlensing to core accretion theory predictions from population synthesis models. The core accretion theory's runaway gas accretion process predicts a dearth of intermediate-mass giant planets that is not seen in the microlensing results. In particular, the models predict \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}times\$ fewer planets at mass ratios of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\} {\textbackslash}leq q {\textbackslash}leq 4 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ than inferred from microlensing observations. This tension implies that gas giant formation may involve processes that have hitherto been overlooked by existing core accretion models or that the planet-forming environment varies considerably as a function of host-star mass. Variation from the usual assumptions for the protoplanetary disk viscosity and thickness could reduce this discrepancy, but such changes might conflict with microlensing results at larger or smaller mass ratios, or with other observations. The resolution of this discrepancy may have important implications for planetary habitability because it has been suggested that the runaway gas accretion process may have triggered the delivery of water to our inner solar system. So, an understanding of giant planet formation may help us to determine the occurrence rate of habitable planets.},

	abstract = {Many binary star systems are not wide enough to contain the progenitor stars from which they were made. One explanation for this is that when one star becomes a red giant a common envelope forms around both stars in the binary system. The core of the giant and its companion star continue to orbit one another inside the envelope. Frictional energy deposited into the common envelope may lead to its ejection and, if so, a close binary system is formed from the core of the former giant star and its relatively untouched companion. When the primary is an asymptotic giant branch star the core becomes a hot carbon-oxygen white dwarf which may ionise the ejected envelope and illuminate a planetary nebula. Many other types of binary systems form through common envelope evolution such as low-mass X-ray binaries and cataclysmic variables. In the case of a failed envelope ejection when the cores merge, rapidly-rotating solitary giants similar to FK Comae stars form. In this short review we focus on attempts to constrain parameters of common envelope evolution models and also describe the latest eﬀorts to model this elusive phase of binary stellar evolution.},

	abstract = {The well-known Bayes theorem assumes that a posterior distribution is a probability distribution. However, the posterior distribution may no longer be a probability distribution if an improper prior distribution (non-probability measure) such as an unbounded uniform prior is used. Improper priors are often used in the astronomical literature to reﬂect on a lack of prior knowledge, but checking whether the resulting posterior is a probability distribution is sometimes neglected. It turns out that 24 articles out of 75 articles (32\%) published online in two renowned astronomy journals (ApJ and MNRAS ) between Jan 1, 2017 and Oct 15, 2017 make use of Bayesian analyses without rigorously establishing posterior propriety. A disturbing aspect is that a Gibbs-type Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method can produce a seemingly reasonable posterior sample even when the posterior is not a probability distribution (Hobert and Casella 1996). In such cases, researchers may erroneously make probabilistic inferences without noticing that the MCMC sample is from a non-existent probability distribution. We review why checking posterior propriety is fundamental in Bayesian analyses when improper priors are used and discuss how we can set up scientiﬁcally motivated proper priors to avoid the pitfalls of using improper priors.},

This is especially true for complex models that are common in practice, as these require sophisticated model implementations and algorithms. In this paper we introduce simulation-based calibration (SBC), a general procedure for validating inferences from Bayesian algorithms capable of generating posterior samples. This procedure not only identiﬁes inaccurate computation and inconsistencies in model implementations but also provides graphical summaries that can indicate the nature of the problems that arise. We argue that SBC is a critical part of a robust Bayesian workﬂow, as well as being a useful tool for those developing computational algorithms and statistical software.},

This is typically carried out via computationally expensive N-body simulations. We show that characterizing the complicated and multi-dimensional stability boundary of tightly packed systems is amenable to machine-learning methods. We ﬁnd that training an XGBoost machine-learning algorithm on physically motivated features yields an accurate classiﬁer of stability in packed systems. On the stability timescale investigated (107 orbits), it is three orders of magnitude faster than direct N-body simulations. Optimized machine-learning classiﬁers for dynamical stability may thus prove useful across the discipline, e.g., to characterize the exoplanet sample discovered by the upcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. This proof of concept motivates investing computational resources to train algorithms capable of predicting stability over longer timescales and over broader regions of phase space.},

	abstract = {Exomoons represent an outstanding challenge in modern astronomy, with the potential to provide rich insights into planet formation theory and habitability. In this work, we stack the phase-folded transits of 284 viable moon hosting Kepler planetary candidates, in order to search for satellites. These planets range from Earth-to-Jupiter sized and from ∼0.1-to-1.0 AU in separation - so-called “warm” planets. Our data processing includes two-pass harmonic detrending, transit timing variations, model selection and careful data quality vetting to produce a grand light curve with a r.m.s. of 5.1 ppm. We ﬁnd that the occurrence rate of Galilean-analog moon systems can be constrained to be η {\textless} 0.38 to 95\% conﬁdence for the 284 KOIs considered, with a 68.3\% conﬁdence interval of η = 0.16+−00..1130. A single-moon model of variable size and separation locates a slight preference for a population of Super-Ios, ∼0.5 R⊕ moons orbiting at 5-10 planetary radii. However, we stress that the low Bayes factor of just 2 in this region means it should be treated as no more than a hint at this time. Splitting our data into various physically-motivated subsets reveals no strong signal. The dearth of Galileananalogs around warm planets places the ﬁrst strong constraint on exomoon formation models to date. Finally, we report evidence for an exomoon candidate Kepler-1625b-i, which we brieﬂy describe ahead of scheduled observations of the target with the Hubble Space Telescope.},

We constrain properties of the binary black hole (BBH) mass spectrum using models with a range of parameterizations of the BBH mass and spin distributions. We ﬁnd that the mass distribution of the more massive black hole in each binary is well approximated by models with almost no black holes larger than 45 M , and a power law index of α = 1.6+−11..57 (90\% credibility). We also show that BBHs are unlikely to be composed of black holes with large spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum. Modelling the evolution of the BBH merger rate with redshift, we show that it is increasing with redshift with credibility 0.88. Marginalizing over uncertainties in the BBH population, we ﬁnd robust estimates of the BBH merger rate density of R = 52.9−+5257..60 Gpc−3 yr−1(90\% credibility). As the BBH catalog grows in future observing runs, we expect that uncertainties in the population model parameters will shrink, potentially providing insights into the formation of black holes via supernovae, binary interactions of massive stars, stellar cluster dynamics, and the formation history of black holes across cosmic time.},

	abstract = {Spurred by the discovery of more than 60 exoplanets in multiple systems, binaries have become in recent years one of the main topics in planet formation research. Numerous studies have investigated to what extent the presence of a stellar companion can aﬀect the planet formation process. Such studies have implications that can reach beyond the sole context of binaries, as they allow to test certain aspects of the planet formation scenario by submitting them to extreme environments. We review here the current understanding on this complex problem. We show in particular how each of the diﬀerent stages of the planet-formation process is aﬀected diﬀerently by binary perturbations. We focus especially on the intermediate stage of kilometre-sized planetesimal accretion, which has proven to be the most sensitive to binarity and for which the presence of some exoplanets observed in tight binaries is diﬃcult to explain by in-situ formation following the ”standard” planet-formation scenario. Some tentative solutions to this apparent paradox are presented. The last part of our review presents a thorough description of the problem of planet habitability, for which the binary environment creates a complex situation because of the presence of two irradiation sources of varying distance.},

We write primarily for an audience of Bayesian novices, but we hope to provide useful insights for seasoned veterans as well. Examples are drawn from gravitational-wave astronomy, though we endeavor for the presentation to be understandable to a broader audience. We begin with a review of the fundamentals: likelihoods, priors, and posteriors. Next, we discuss Bayesian evidence, Bayes factors, odds ratios, and model selection. From there, we describe how posteriors are estimated using samplers such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms and nested sampling. Finally, we generalize the formalism to discuss hyper-parameters and hierarchical models. We include extensive appendices discussing the creation of credible intervals, Gaussian noise, explicit marginalization, posterior predictive distributions, and selection effects.},

In particular, we distill probabilistic programming down to a single abstraction—the random variable. Our lightweight implementation in TensorFlow enables numerous applications: a model-parallel variational auto-encoder (VAE) with 2nd-generation tensor processing units (TPUv2s); a data-parallel autoregressive model (Image Transformer) with TPUv2s; and multiGPU No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). For both a state-of-the-art VAE on 64x64 ImageNet and Image Transformer on 256x256 CelebA-HQ, our approach achieves an optimal linear speedup from 1 to 256 TPUv2 chips. With NUTS, we see a 100x speedup on GPUs over Stan and 37x over PyMC3.},

	abstract = {We explore the possibility that the observed eccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets arose through planet-planet interactions, after the initial stage of planet formation was complete. Our results are based on \$3250 numerical integrations of ensembles of randomly constructed planetary systems, each lasting 100 Myr. We ﬁnd that for a remarkably wide range of initial conditions the eccentricity distributions of dynamically active planetary systems relax toward a common ﬁnal equilibrium distribution, well described by the ﬁtting formula dn / eexp ½À12 (e/0:3)2 de. This distribution agrees well with the observed eccentricity distribution for e k 0:2 but predicts too few planets at lower eccentricities, even when we exclude planets subject to tidal circularization. These ﬁndings suggest that a period of large-scale dynamical instability has occurred in a signiﬁcant fraction of newly formed planetary systems, lasting 1Y2 orders of magnitude longer than the \$1 Myr interval in which gas giant planets are assembled. This mechanism predicts no (or weak) correlations between semimajor axis, eccentricity, inclination, and mass in dynamically relaxed planetary systems. An additional observational consequence of dynamical relaxation is a signiﬁcant population of planets (k10\%) that are highly inclined (k25 ) with respect to the initial symmetry plane of the protoplanetary disk; this population may be detectable in transiting planets through the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.},

	abstract = {Research in many areas of modern physics such as, e.g., indirect searches for dark matter and particle acceleration in supernova remnant shocks rely heavily on studies of cosmic rays (CRs) and associated diffuse emissions (radio, microwave, X-rays, γ -rays). While very detailed numerical models of CR propagation exist, a quantitative statistical analysis of such models has been so far hampered by the large computational effort that those models require. Although statistical analyses have been carried out before using semi-analytical models (where the computation is much faster), the evaluation of the results obtained from such models is difﬁcult, as they necessarily suffer from many simplifying assumptions. The main objective of this paper is to present a working method for a full Bayesian parameter estimation for a numerical CR propagation model. For this study, we use the GALPROP code, the most advanced of its kind, which uses astrophysical information, and nuclear and particle data as inputs to selfconsistently predict CRs, γ -rays, synchrotron, and other observables. We demonstrate that a full Bayesian analysis is possible using nested sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (implemented in the SuperBayeS code) despite the heavy computational demands of a numerical propagation code. The best-ﬁt values of parameters found in this analysis are in agreement with previous, signiﬁcantly simpler, studies also based on GALPROP.},

	abstract = {We present a data-driven method—heteroscedastic matrix factorization, a kind of probabilistic factor analysis—for modeling or performing dimensionality reduction on observed spectra or other high-dimensional data with known but non-uniform observational uncertainties. The method uses an iterative inverse-variance-weighted least-squares minimization procedure to generate a best set of basis functions. The method is similar to principal components analysis (PCA), but with the substantial advantage that it uses measurement uncertainties in a responsible way and accounts naturally for poorly measured and missing data; it models the variance in the noise-deconvolved data space. A regularization can be applied, in the form of a smoothness prior (inspired by Gaussian processes) or a non-negative constraint, without making the method prohibitively slow. Because the method optimizes a justiﬁed scalar (related to the likelihood), the basis provides a better ﬁt to the data in a probabilistic sense than any PCA basis. We test the method on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra, concentrating on spectra known to contain two redshift components: these are spectra of gravitational lens candidates and massive black hole binaries. We apply a hypothesis test to compare one-redshift and two-redshift models for these spectra, utilizing the data-driven model trained on a random subset of all SDSS spectra. This test conﬁrms 129 of the 131 lens candidates in our sample and all of the known binary candidates, and turns up very few false positives.},

	abstract = {Transit timing variations (TTVs) are a valuable tool to determine the masses and orbits of transiting planets in multi-planet systems. TTVs can be readily modeled given knowledge of the interacting planets’ orbital conﬁgurations and planet-star mass ratios, but such models are highly nonlinear and diﬃcult to invert. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are often used to explore the posterior distribution for model parameters, but, due to the high correlations between parameters, nonlinearity, and potential multi-modality in the posterior, many samplers perform very ineﬃciently. Therefore, we assess the performance of several MCMC samplers that use varying degrees of geometric information about the target distribution. We generate synthetic datasets from multiple models, including the TTVFaster model and a simple sinusoidal model, and test the eﬃciencies of various MCMC samplers. We ﬁnd that sampling efﬁciency can be greatly improved for all models by sampling from a parameter space transformed using an estimate of the covariance and means of the target distribution. No one sampler performs the best for all datasets, but several samplers, such as Diﬀerential Evolution Monte Carlo and Geometric adaptive Monte Carlo, have consistently eﬃcient performance. For datasets with near Gaussian posteriors, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers with 2 or 3 leapfrog steps obtained the highest eﬃciencies. Based on diﬀerences in eﬀective sample sizes per time, we show that the right choice of sampler can improve sampling eﬃciencies by several orders of magnitude.},

We explore properties and evolution of such circumbinary disks focusing on modiﬁcation of their structure caused by tidal coupling to the binary. We develop a set of analytical scaling relations describing viscous evolution of the disk properties, which are veriﬁed and calibrated using 1D numerical calculations with realistic inputs. Injection of angular momentum by the central binary suppresses mass accretion onto the binary and causes radial distribution of the viscous angular momentum ﬂux FJ to be different from that in a standard accretion disk around a single star with no torque at the center. Disks with no mass accretion at the center develop anFJ proﬁle that is ﬂat in radius. Radial proﬁles of temperature and surface density are also quite different from those in disks around single stars. Damping of the density waves driven by the binary and viscous dissipation dominates heating of the inner disk (within 1–2 AU), pushing the ice line beyond 3–5 AU, depending on disk mass and age. Irradiation by the binary governs disk thermodynamics beyond ∼10 AU. However, self-shadowing by the hot inner disk may render central illumination irrelevant out to ∼20 AU. Spectral energy distribution of a circumbinary disk exhibits a distinctive bump around 10 μm, which may facilitate identiﬁcation of such disks around unresolved binaries. Efﬁcient tidal coupling to the disk drives orbital inspiral of the binary and may cause low-mass and relatively compact binaries to merge into a single star within the disk lifetime. We generally ﬁnd that circumbinary disks present favorable sites for planet formation (despite their wider zone of volatile depletion), in agreement with the statistics of Kepler circumbinary planets.},

We introduce an efﬁcient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the ﬁnite case with weak priors or inﬂuential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models.

However, self-consistently linking a planetary system across these two phases of stellar evolution through the violent giant branch poses computational challenges, and previous studies restricted architectures to equal-mass planets. Here, we remove this constraint and perform over 450 numerical integrations over a Hubble time (14 Gyr) of packed planetary systems with unequal-mass planets. We characterize the resulting trends as a function of planet order and mass. We ﬁnd that intrusive radial incursions in the vicinity of the white dwarf become less likely as the dispersion amongst planet masses increases. The orbital meandering which may sustain a sufﬁciently dynamic environment around a white dwarf to explain observations is more dependent on the presence of terrestrial-mass planets than any variation in planetary mass. Triggering unpacking or instability during the white dwarf phase is comparably easy for systems of unequal-mass planets and systems of equal-mass planets; instabilities during the giant branch phase remain rare and require ﬁne-tuning of initial conditions. We list the key dynamical features of each simulation individually as a potential guide for upcoming discoveries.},

Here, we determine how a binary companion triggers instability in otherwise unconditionally stable single-star twoplanet systems during the giant branch and white dwarf phases of the planet host. We perform about 700 full-lifetime (14 Gyr) simulations with A0 and F0 primary stars and secondary K2 companions, and identify the critical binary distance within which instability is triggered at any point during stellar evolution. We estimate this distance to be about seven times the outer planet separation for circular binaries. Our results help characterize the fates of planetary systems, and in particular which ones might yield architectures which are conducive to generating observable metal pollution in white dwarf atmospheres.},

A frequently invoked mechanism for generating this population is a dynamical instability that incites planet–planet scattering and the ejection of one or more planets in isolated main-sequence planetary systems. Here, we demonstrate that this process alone probably cannot represent the sole source of these Galactic wanderers. By using straightforward quantitative arguments and N-body simulations, we argue that the observed number of exoplanets exceeds the plausible number of ejected planets per system from scattering. Thus, other potential sources of free ﬂoaters, such as planetary stripping in stellar clusters and post-main-sequence ejection, must be considered.},

	abstract = {Extrasolar planets and belts of debris orbiting post-main-sequence single stars may become unbound as the evolving star loses mass. In multiple-star systems, the presence or co-evolution of the additional stars can signiﬁcantly complicate the prospects for orbital excitation and escape. Here, we investigate the dynamical consequences of multi-phasic, non-linear mass loss and establish a criterion for a system of any stellar multiplicity to retain a planet whose orbit surrounds all of the parent stars. For single stars which become white dwarfs, this criterion can be combined with the Chandrasekhar Limit to establish the maximum allowable mass-loss rate for planet retention. We then apply the criterion to circumbinary planets in evolving binary systems over the entire stellar mass phase space. Through about 105 stellar evolutionary track realizations, we characterize planetary ejection prospects as a function of binary separation, stellar mass and metallicity. This investigation reveals that planets residing at just a few tens of au from a central concentration of stars are susceptible to escape in a wide variety of multiple systems. Further, planets are signiﬁcantly more susceptible to ejection from multiple-star systems than from single-star systems for a given system mass. For system masses greater than about 2 M , multiple-star systems represent the greater source of free-ﬂoating planets.},

We discuss a set of simple equations that determine upper and lower limits for orbital expansion and investigate the eﬀect of initial eccentricity. We deduce the range of possible semi-major axes and initial eccentricity values of the planets prior to the common-envelope event. In addition to spherically-symmetric mass-ejection events, we consider planetary dynamics under the inﬂuence of an expanding disk. In order to have survived, we suggest that the present planets in NN Ser must have had semi-major axes {\textgreater}∼10 AU and high eccentricity values which is in conﬂict with current observations. Consequently, we argue that these planets were not formed together with their hosting stellar system, but rather originated from the fraction of matter of the envelope that remained bound to the binary. According to the cooling age of the white dwarf primary of 106 yr, the planets around NN Ser might be the youngest known so far and open up a wide range of further study of second generation planet formation.},

	abstract = {Modern problems in astronomical Bayesian inference require eﬃcient methods for sampling from complex, high-dimensional, often multi-modal probability distributions. Most popular methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, perform poorly on strongly multi-modal probability distributions, rarely jumping between modes or settling on just one mode without ﬁnding others. Parallel tempering addresses this problem by sampling simultaneously with separate Markov chains from tempered versions of the target distribution with reduced contrast levels. Gaps between modes can be traversed at higher temperatures, while individual modes can be eﬃciently explored at lower temperatures. In this paper, we investigate how one might choose the ladder of temperatures to achieve more eﬃcient sampling, as measured by the autocorrelation time of the sampler. In particular, we present a simple, easily-implemented algorithm for dynamically adapting the temperature conﬁguration of a sampler while sampling. This algorithm dynamically adjusts the temperature spacing to achieve a uniform rate of exchanges between chains at neighbouring temperatures. We compare the algorithm to conventional geometric temperature conﬁgurations on a number of test distributions and on an astrophysical inference problem, reporting eﬃciency gains by a factor of 1.2–2.5 over a well-chosen geometric temperature conﬁguration and by a factor of 1.5–5 over a poorly chosen conﬁguration. On all of these problems a sampler using the dynamical adaptations to achieve uniform acceptance ratios between neighbouring chains outperforms one that does not.},

	abstract = {Faint tidal features around galaxies record their merger and interaction histories over cosmic time. Due to their low surface brightnesses and complex morphologies, existing automated methods struggle to detect such features and most work to date has heavily relied on visual inspection. This presents a major obstacle to quantitative study of tidal debris features in large statistical samples, and hence the ability to be able to use these features to advance understanding of the galaxy population as a whole. This paper uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with dropout and augmentation to identify galaxies in the CFHTLS-Wide Survey that have faint tidal features. Evaluating the performance of the CNNs against previously-published expert visual classiﬁcations, we ﬁnd that our method achieves high (76\%) completeness and low (20\%) contamination, and also performs considerably better than other automated methods recently applied in the literature. We argue that CNNs oﬀer a promising approach to eﬀective automatic identiﬁcation of low surface brightness tidal debris features in and around galaxies. When applied to forthcoming deep wide-ﬁeld imaging surveys (e.g. LSST, Euclid), CNNs have the potential to provide a several order-of-magnitude increase in the sample size of morphologically-perturbed galaxies and thereby facilitate a much-anticipated revolution in terms of quantitative low surface brightness science.},

By partitioning and distributing kernel matrix multiplies, we demonstrate that an exact GP can be trained on over a million points in 3 days using 8 GPUs and can compute predictive means and variances in under a second using 1 GPU at test time.

We combine N-body dynamical models ﬁtted to the Milky Way’s Boxy/Peanut bulge with exponential disk models outside this, and compute the microlensing properties. Considering the range of models consistent with the revised MOA-II data, we ﬁnd low dark matter fractions in the inner Galaxy: at the peak of their stellar rotation curve a fraction fv = (0.88 ± 0.07) of the circular velocity is baryonic (at 1σ , fv {\textgreater} 0.72 at 2σ ). These results are in agreement with constraints from the EROS-II microlensing survey of brighter resolved stars, where we ﬁnd fv = (0.9 ± 0.1) at 1σ . Our ﬁducial model of a disk with scale length 2.6 kpc, and a bulge with a low dark matter fraction of 12\%, agrees with both the revised MOA-II and EROS-II microlensing data. The required baryonic fractions, and the resultant low contribution from dark matter, are consistent with the NFW proﬁles produced by dissipationless cosmological simulations in Milky Way mass galaxies. They are also consistent with recent prescriptions for the mild adiabatic contraction of Milky Way mass haloes without the need for strong feedback, but there is some tension with recent measurements of the local dark matter density. Microlensing optical depths from the larger OGLE-III sample could improve these constraints further when available.},

This is true even when considering systems with similar host stars; we ﬁnd, at most, a weak correlation between planet radius and stellar mass. Evidently, it is not the stellar mass but some other property or process that enforces the similarity of planet sizes. When adjacent planets in a multi-planet system are not similar in size, the inner planet is smaller in 65±6\% of cases. The tendency for the inner planet to be smaller is especially pronounced when the inner planet has a short period ( 10 days) or equivalently, high radiation ﬂux ( 150 times the Earth’s insolation). This could be the result of photoevaporation. We also ﬁnd that adjacent planets within a given system tend to be spaced in a regular geometric progression, with a typical semi-major axis ratio of 1.5. Using empirical mass-radius relationships, we estimate the mutual Hill separations of planet pairs. We ﬁnd that 93\% of the planet pairs are at least 10 mutual Hill radii apart, and that a spacing of 10-30 mutual Hill radii is most common.},

	abstract = {Most Sun-like stars in the Galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs of stars called "binary stars". While long anticipated, the existence of a "circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitively established until the discovery of Kepler-16. Incontrovertible evidence was provided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet. However, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets and their range of orbital and physical properties. Here we present two additional transiting circumbinary planets, Kepler-34 and Kepler-35. Each is a low-density gas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars. Kepler-34 orbits two Sun-like stars every 289 days, while Kepler-35 orbits a pair of smaller stars (89\% and 81\% of the Sun's mass) every 131 days. Due to the orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodic variations in incident stellar radiation. The observed rate of circumbinary planets implies {\textgreater} {\textasciitilde}1\% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearly coplanar orbits, yielding a Galactic population of at least several million.},

	abstract = {By design, model-based approaches for ﬂagging transiting exoplanets in light curves, such as boxed least squares, excel at detecting planets with low S/N at the expense of ﬁnding signals that are not well described by the assumed model, such as self-lensing binaries, disintegrating or evaporating planets, or planets with large rings. So far, such signals have typically been found through visual searches by professional or citizen scientists, or by inspection of the photometric power-spectra. We present a nonparametric detection algorithm, for short duty-cycle periodic signals in photometric time series based on phase dispersion minimization. We apply our code to 161,786 Kepler sources and detect 18 new periodic signals consistent with heartbeat binaries/planets, 4 new singly-transiting systems, and 2 new doubly-transiting systems. We show that our code is able to recover the majority of known Kepler objects of interest (KOIs) to high conﬁdence, as well as more unusual events such as Boyajian’s star and a comet passing through the Kepler ﬁeld. Nonparametric signal-ﬂagging techniques, such as the one presented here, will become increasingly valuable with the coming data from TESS and future transit surveys as the volume of data available to us exceeds that which can be feasibly examined manually.},

Since then, Doppler and transit surveys have revealed the population of planets around other Sun-like stars, especially those with orbital periods shorter than a few years. Over the last decade these surveys have risen to new heights with Doppler spectrographs capable of 1 m s−1 precision, and space telescopes capable of detecting the transits of Earth-sized planets.

	abstract = {The precise radial velocity technique is a cornerstone of exoplanetary astronomy. Astronomers measure Doppler shifts in the star’s spectral features, which track the line-of-sight gravitational accelerations of a star caused by the planets orbiting it. The method has its roots in binary star astronomy, and exoplanet detection represents the low-companion-mass limit of that application. This limit requires control of several effects of much greater magnitude than the signal sought: the motion of the telescope must be subtracted, the instrument must be calibrated, and spurious Doppler shifts “jitter” must be mitigated or corrected. Two primary forms of instrumental calibration are the stable spectrograph and absorption cell methods, the former being the path taken for the next generation of spectrographs. Spurious, apparent Doppler shifts due to non-center-of-mass motion (jitter) can be the result of stellar magnetic activity or photospheric motions and granulation. Several avoidance, mitigation, and correction strategies exist, including careful analysis of line shapes and radial velocity wavelength dependence.},

The preferred mass ratio between the lens star and its companion is q = 10−3.7±0.1, placing the candidate companion in the planetary regime. Despite the formal signiﬁcance of the planet, we show that because of systematics in the data the evidence for a planetary companion to the lens is too tenuous to claim a secure detection. When combined with analyses of other high-magniﬁcation events, this event helps empirically deﬁne the threshold for reliable planet detection in high-magniﬁcation events, which remains an open question.},

	abstract = {Microlensing can access planet populations that no other method can probe: cold wide-orbit planets beyond the snow line, planets in both the Galactic bulge and disk, and free floating planets (FFPs). The demographics of each population will provide unique constraints on planet formation. Over the past 5 years, U.S. microlensing campaigns with Spitzer and UKIRT have provided a powerful complement to international ground-based microlensing surveys, with major breakthroughs in parallax measurements and probing new regions of the Galaxy. The scientific vitality of these projects has also promoted the development of the U.S. microlensing community. In the 2020s, the U.S. can continue to play a major role in ground-based microlensing by leveraging U.S. assets to complement ongoing ground-based international surveys. LSST and UKIRT microlensing surveys would probe vast regions of the Galaxy, where planets form under drastically different conditions. Moreover, while ground-based surveys will measure the planet mass-ratio function beyond the snow line, adaptive optics (AO) observations with ELTs would turn all of these mass ratios into masses and also distinguish between very wide-orbit planets and genuine FFPs. To the extent possible, cooperation of U.S. scientists with international surveys should also be encouraged and supported.},

We use the resulting ﬁnite-source effects to measure the angular Einstein radius,  E ¼ 195 Æ 17  as, and so constrain the lens mass to the FWHM interval 0:08 {\textless} M =M  {\textless} 0:54. The lens-source relative proper motion is  rel ¼ 27 Æ 2 km sÀ1 kpcÀ1. Both values are typical of what is expected for lenses detected toward the bulge. Despite the short duration of the event, we detect marginal evidence for a ‘‘parallax asymmetry’’ but argue that this is more likely to be induced by acceleration of the source, a binary lens, or possibly by statistical ﬂuctuations. Although OGLE-2003-BLG-262 is only the second published event to date in which the lens transits the source, such events will become more common with the new OGLE-III survey in place. We therefore give a detailed account of the analysis of this event to facilitate the study of future events of this type.},

The simultaneous observations from Spitzer and the ground yield measurements of the microlensing parallax vector pE, from which compact constraints on the microlens properties are derived, including 25\% uncertainties on the lens mass and distance. With the current sample, we demonstrate that the majority of microlenses are indeed in the mass range of M dwarfs. The planet sensitivities of all 41 events in the sample are calculated, from which we provide constraints on the planet distribution function. In particular, assuming a planet distribution function that is uniform in log q, where q is the planet-to-star mass ratio, we ﬁnd a 95\% upper limit on the fraction of stars that host typical microlensing planets of 49\%, which is consistent with previous studies. Based on this planet-free sample, we develop the methodology to statistically study the Galactic distribution of planets using microlensing parallax measurements. Under the assumption that the planet distributions are the same in the bulge as in the disk, we predict that ∼1/3 of all planet detections from the microlensing campaigns with Spitzer should be in the bulge. This prediction will be tested with a much larger sample, and deviations from it can be used to constrain the abundance of planets in the bulge relative to the disk.},

We compiled a comprehensive list of observed eclipsing PCEBs, estimated the fraction of systems showing apparent period variations, reconstructed the evolutionary history of the PCEBs, and performed binary population models of PCEBs to characterize their main sequence binary progenitors. We reviewed the currently available constraints on the fraction of PCEB progenitors that host circumbinary giant planets.
Results. We ﬁnd that the progenitors of PCEBs are very unlikely to be frequent hosts of giant planets (∼{\textless}10 per cent), while the frequency of PCEBs with observed apparent period variations is very high (∼90 per cent).
Conclusions. The variations in eclipse timings measured in eclipsing PCEBs are probably not caused by ﬁrst-generation planets that survived common-envelope evolution. The remaining options for explaining the observed period variations are second-generation planet formation or perhaps variations in the shape of a magnetically active secondary star. We suggest observational tests for both options.},

	abstract = {The detection of transiting exoplanets in time-series photometry requires the removal or modeling of instrumental and stellar noise. While instrumental systematics can be reduced using methods such as pixel level decorrelation, removing stellar trends while preserving transit signals proves challenging. Due to vast archives of light curves from recent transit surveys, there is a strong need for accurate automatic detrending, without human intervention. A large variety of detrending algorithms are in active use, but their comparative performance for transit discovery is unexplored. We benchmark all commonly used detrending methods against hundreds of Kepler, K2, and TESS planets, selected to represent the most diﬃcult cases for systems with small planet-to-star radius ratios. The full parameter range is explored for each method to determine the best choices for planet discovery. We conclude that the ideal method is a time-windowed slider with an iterative robust location estimator based on Tukey’s biweight. This method recovers 99 \% and 94 \% of the shallowest Kepler and K2 planets, respectively. We include an additional analysis for young stars with extreme variability and conclude they are best treated using a spline-based method with a robust Huber estimator. All stellar detrending methods explored are available for public use in Wo¯tan, an open-source Python package on GitHub ( https://github.com/hippke/wotan).},

The term “nonparametric Bayes” suggests that these methods inherit model-free operating characteristics of classical nonparametric methods, as well as coherent uncertainty assessments provided by Bayesian procedures. However, as the authors say in the conclusion to their article, nonparametric Bayesian methods may be more aptly described as “massively parametric.” Furthermore, I argue that many of the default nonparametric Bayes procedures are only Bayesian in the weakest sense of the term, and cannot be assumed to provide honest assessments of uncertainty merely because they carry the Bayesian label. However useful such procedures may be, we should be cautious about advertising default nonparametric Bayes procedures as either being “assumption free” or providing descriptions of our uncertainty. If we want our nonparametric Bayes procedures to have a Bayesian interpretation, we should modify default NP Bayes methods to accommodate real prior information, or at the very least, carefully evaluate the eﬀects of hyperparameters on posterior quantities of interest.},

Standard weighted least-squares ﬁtting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being ﬁt. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a “generative model” for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent ﬁtting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are “nuisance parameters” to marginalize away.},

	abstract = {Given sparse or low-quality radial velocity measurements of a star, there are often many qualitatively different stellar or exoplanet companion orbit models that are consistent with the data. The consequent multimodality of the likelihood function leads to extremely challenging search, optimization, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior sampling over the orbital parameters. Here we create a custom Monte Carlo sampler for sparse or noisy radial velocity measurements of two-body systems that can produce posterior samples for orbital parameters even when the likelihood function is poorly behaved. The six standard orbital parameters for a binary system can be split into four nonlinear parameters (period, eccentricity, argument of pericenter, phase) and two linear parameters (velocity amplitude, barycenter velocity). We capitalize on this by building a sampling method in which we densely sample the prior probability density function (pdf)in the nonlinear parameters and perform rejection sampling using a likelihood function marginalized over the linear parameters. With sparse or uninformative data, the sampling obtained by this rejection sampling is generally multimodal and dense. With informative data, the sampling becomes effectively unimodal but too sparse: in these cases we follow the rejection sampling with standard MCMC. The method produces correct samplings in orbital parameters for data that include as few as three epochs. TheJoker can therefore be used to produce proper samplings of multimodal pdfs, which are still informative and can be used in hierarchical (population) modeling. We give some examples that show how the posterior pdf depends sensitively on the number and time coverage of the observations and their uncertainties.},

The orbital parameters of the sample systems were measured applying the traditional method of light curve adjustment with uncertainties calculated by the bootstrap method, employing the JKTEBOP code. These estimated parameters were compared with those obtained by the neural network approach for the same systems. The results reveal a good agreement between techniques for the sum of the fractional radii and moderate agreement for e cos ω and e sin ω, but orbital inclination is clearly underestimated in neural network tests.},

From the results, empirical expressions are developed for both (1) the largest orbit around each of the stars and (2) the smallest orbit around the binary system as a whole, in which test particles survive the length of the integration (104 binary periods). The empirical expressions developed, which are roughly linear in both the mass ratio k and the binary eccentricity e, are determined for the range 0.0 ¹ e ¹ 0.7È0.8 and 0.1 ¹ k ¹ 0.9 in both regions and can be used to guide searches for planets in binary systems. After considering the case of a single low-mass planet in binary systems, the stability of a mutually interacting system of planets orbiting one star of a binary system is examined, though in less detail.},

In high dimensions, the sampler’s ‘stretch move’ has unusual and undesirable properties. We demonstrate this with an n-dimensional correlated Gaussian toy problem with a known mean and covariance structure, and a multivariate version of the Rosenbrock problem. Visual inspection of trace plots suggests the burn-in period is short. Upon closer inspection, we discover the mean and the variance of the target distribution do not match the known values, and the chain takes a very long time to converge. This problem becomes severe as n increases beyond 50. We therefore conclude that the stretch move should not be relied upon (in isolation) in moderate to high dimensions. We also present some theoretical results explaining this behaviour.},

	abstract = {Neutron stars are a prime laboratory for testing physical processes under conditions of strong gravity, high density, and extreme magnetic ﬁelds. Among the zoo of neutron star phenomena, magnetars stand out for their bursting behavior, ranging from extremely bright, rare giant ﬂares to numerous, less energetic recurrent bursts. The exact trigger and emission mechanisms for these bursts are not known; favored models involve either a crust fracture and subsequent energy release into the magnetosphere, or explosive reconnection of magnetic ﬁeld lines. In the absence of a predictive model, understanding the physical processes responsible for magnetar burst variability is difﬁcult. Here, we develop an empirical model that decomposes magnetar bursts into a superposition of small spike-like features with a simple functional form, where the number of model components is itself part of the inference problem. The cascades of spikes that we model might be formed by avalanches of reconnection, or crust rupture aftershocks. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling augmented with reversible jumps between models with different numbers of parameters, we characterize the posterior distributions of the model parameters and the number of components per burst. We relate these model parameters to physical quantities in the system, and show for the ﬁrst time that the variability within a burst does not conform to predictions from ideas of self-organized criticality. We also examine how well the properties of the spikes ﬁt the predictions of simpliﬁed cascade models for the different trigger mechanisms.},

In the 3L1S and 2L2S interpretations, the host is a brown dwarf and the dominant companion is a Neptune-class planet, with the third body (in the 3L1S case) being a Mars-class object that could have been a moon of the planet. In the 1L3S solution, the light curve anomalies are explained by a tight (five stellar radii) low-luminosity binary source that is offset from the principal source of the event by \${\textbackslash}sim 0.17{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}au\$. These degeneracies are resolved in favor of the 1L3S solution by color effects derived from comparison to MOA data, which are taken in a slightly different (\$R/I\$) passband.

	abstract = {We recommend that the search for exoplanets around binary stars be extended to include X-ray binaries in which the accretor is a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole. We present a novel idea for detecting planets bound to such mass transfer binaries: we propose that the X-ray light curves of these binaries be inspected for signatures of transiting planets. X-ray transits may be the only way to detect planets around some systems, while providing a complementary approach to optical and/or radio observations in others. Any planets associated with X-ray binaries must be in stable orbits. We consider the range of allowable separations and ﬁnd that orbital periods can be hours or longer, while transit durations extend upward from about a minute for Earth-radius planets in very close orbits, to hours for Jupiter-radius planets in wider orbits. The search for planets around mass transfer binaries could begin at once with existing X-ray observations of these systems. If and when a planet is detected around an X-ray binary, the size and mass of the planet may be readily measured, and it may also be possible to study the transmission and absorption of X-rays through its atmosphere. Finally, a noteworthy application of our proposal is that the same technique could be used to search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence. If an advanced exocivilization placed a Dyson sphere or similar structure in orbit around the accretor of an X-ray binary in order to capture energy, such an artiﬁcial structure might cause detectable transits in the X-ray light curve.},

	abstract = {Implicit probabilistic models are a ﬂexible class of models deﬁned by a simulation process for data. They form the basis for theories which encompass our understanding of the physical world. Despite this fundamental nature, the use of implicit models remains limited due to challenges in specifying complex latent structure in them, and in performing inferences in such models with large data sets. In this paper, we ﬁrst introduce hierarchical implicit models (HIMs). HIMs combine the idea of implicit densities with hierarchical Bayesian modeling, thereby deﬁning models via simulators of data with rich hidden structure. Next, we develop likelihood-free variational inference (LFVI), a scalable variational inference algorithm for HIMs. Key to LFVI is specifying a variational family that is also implicit. This matches the model’s ﬂexibility and allows for accurate approximation of the posterior. We demonstrate diverse applications: a large-scale physical simulator for predator-prey populations in ecology; a Bayesian generative adversarial network for discrete data; and a deep implicit model for text generation.},

	abstract = {We propose a hierarchical approach to testing general relativity with multiple gravitational wave detections. Unlike existing strategies, our method does not assume that parameters quantifying deviations from general relativity are either common or completely unrelated accross all sources. We instead assume that these parameters follow some underlying distribution, which we parametrize and constrain. This can be then compared to the distribution expected from general relativity, i.e. no deviation in any of the events. We demonstrate that our method is robust to measurement uncertainties and can be applied to theories of gravity where the parameters beyond general relativity are related to each other, as generally expected. Our method contains the two extremes of common and unrelated parameters as limiting cases. We apply the hierarchical model to the population of 10 binary black hole systems so far detected by LIGO and Virgo. We do this for a parametrized test of gravitational wave generation, by assuming that the beyond-general-relativity parameters follow a Gaussian distribution. We compute the posterior distribution for the mean and the variance of the population and show that both are consistent with general relativity.},

	abstract = {Accumulation of dust and ice particles into planetesimals is an important step in the planet formation process. Planetesimals are the seeds of both terrestrial planets and the solid cores of gas and ice giants forming by core accretion. Left-over planetesimals in the form of asteroids, trans-Neptunian objects and comets provide a unique record of the physical conditions in the solar nebula. Debris from planetesimal collisions around other stars signposts that the planetesimal formation process, and hence planet formation, is ubiquitous in the Galaxy. The planetesimal formation stage extends from micrometer-sized dust and ice to bodies which can undergo run-away accretion. The latter ranges in size from 1 km to 1000 km, dependent on the planetesimal eccentricity excited by turbulent gas density fluctuations. Particles face many barriers during this growth, arising mainly from inefficient sticking, fragmentation and radial drift. Two promising growth pathways are mass transfer, where small aggregates transfer up to 50\% of their mass in high-speed collisions with much larger targets, and fluffy growth, where aggregate cross sections and sticking probabilities are enhanced by a low internal density. A wide range of particle sizes, from mm to 10 m, concentrate in the turbulent gas flow. Overdense filaments fragment gravitationally into bound particle clumps, with most mass entering planetesimals of contracted radii from 100 to 500 km, depending on local disc properties. We propose a hybrid model for planetesimal formation where particle growth starts unaided by self-gravity but later proceeds inside gravitationally collapsing pebble clumps to form planetesimals with a wide range of sizes.},

In this work, we discuss the properties of a Gaussian process regression model with the Student-t likelihood and utilize the Laplace approximation for approximate inference.

For the synthetic data, we recover the input parameters. For OGLE-2007-BLG-472 we ﬁnd that while χ2 is minimised for a planetary massratio model with extremely long timescale, the introduction of priors and minimisation of BIC, rather than χ2, favours a more plausible lens model, a binary star with components of 0.78 and 0.11 M⊙ at a distance of 6.3 kpc, compared to our previous result of 1.50 and 0.12 M⊙ at a distance of 1 kpc.},

	abstract = {We consider a novel paradigm for Bayesian testing of hypotheses and Bayesian model comparison. Our alternative to the traditional construction of Bayes factors or posterior probabilities of a model given the data is to consider the hypotheses or models under comparison as components of a mixture model. We therefore replace the original testing problem with an estimation one that focuses on the probability or weight of a given hypothesis within the mixture model. We analyse the sensitivity of the posterior distribution of the weights induced by diﬀerent priors on these quantities. We stress that a major appeal in using this novel perspective is that generic improper priors are acceptable. Among other features, this allows for a resolution of the Lindley–Jeﬀreys paradox. For example, a reference Beta B(a0, a0) prior on the mixture weights can be used for the common problem of testing two contrasting hypotheses or models. In this case the sensitivity of the posterior estimates of the weights to the choice of a0 vanishes as the sample size increases. We therefore advocate a default choice of a0 = 0.5, derived from Rousseau and Mengersen (2011). Similar results apply for testing more than two alternatives. Another feature of this easily implemented alternative to the classical Bayesian solution is that the speeds of convergence of the posterior mean of the weight and of the corresponding posterior probability are quite similar.},

This event was located near the K2 Campaign 9 ﬁeld that was observed by a large number of telescopes. As a result, the event was in the microlensing survey area of a number of these telescopes, and this enabled good coverage of the planetary light-curve signal. High angular resolution adaptive optics images from the Keck telescope reveal excess ﬂux at the position of the source above the ﬂux of the source star, as indicated by the light-curve model. This excess ﬂux could be due to the lens star, but it could also be due to a companion to the source or lens star, or even an unrelated star. We consider all these possibilities in a Bayesian analysis in the context of a standard Galactic model. Our analysis indicates that it is unlikely that a large fraction of the excess ﬂux comes from the lens, unless solar-type stars are much more likely to host planets of this mass ratio than lower mass stars. We recommend that a method similar to the one developed in this paper be used for other events with high angular resolution follow-up observations when the follow-up observations are insufﬁcient to measure the lens–source relative proper motion.},

	abstract = {The true multiplicity distribution of transiting planet systems is obscured by strong observational biases, leading low-multiplicity systems to be overrepresented in the observed sample. Using the Kepler FGK planet hosts, we employ approximate Bayesian computation to infer the multiplicity distribution by comparing simulated catalogs to the observed one. After comparing a total of ten diﬀerent multiplicity distributions, half of which were two-population models, to the observed data, we ﬁnd that a singlepopulation model following a Zipﬁan distribution is able to explain the Kepler data as well as any of the dichotomous models we test. Our work provides another example of a way to explain the observed Kepler multiplicities without invoking a dichotomous planet population. Using our preferred Zipﬁan model, we estimate that an additional 2393+−791047 planets likely reside in the 1537 FGK Kepler systems studied in this work, which would increase the planet count by a factor of 2.22−+00..3466. Of these hidden worlds, 663−+115581 are expected to reside in ostensibly single-transiting-planet systems, meaning that an additional planet(s) is expected for approximately 1-in-2 such Kepler systems.},

These data provide insight into the global properties of Io’s volcanism. Several new hot spots and bright eruptions have been detected, and the preference for bright eruptions to occur on Io’s trailing hemisphere noted in the 2013–2015 data is strengthened by the larger data set and remains unexplained.

We additionally present analytic formulae for the partial derivatives of instantaneous ﬂux with respect to the radius ratio, impact parameter, and limb darkening coeﬃcients. These expressions are rapid to evaluate, and compare quite favorably in speed and accuracy to existing transit light curve codes. We also use these expressions to numerically compute the ﬁrst partial derivatives of exposure-time averaged transit light curves with respect to all model parameters. An additional application is modeling eclipsing binary or eclipsing multiple star systems in cases where the stars may be treated as spherically symmetric. We provide code which implements these formulae in C++, Python, IDL, and Julia, with tests and examples of usage.},

Dust estimation and dereddening is done iteratively inside the model and without prior distance information, using the Bayestar map. The signal-to-noise (precision) of distance measurements improves on average by more than 48\% over the raw Gaia data, and we also demonstrate how the accuracy of distances have improved over other models, especially in the noisy-parallax regime. Applications are discussed, including signiﬁcantly improved Milky Way disk separation and substructure detection. We conclude with a discussion of future work, which exploits the normalizing ﬂow architecture to allow us to exactly marginalize over missing photometry, enabling the inclusion of many surveys without losing coverage.},

where βec is the ecliptic latitude, ψ is the phase
of the Earth's orbit relative to opposition at the time of the event
maximum, and v⊕=30kms-1 is the speed of the
Earth. The degeneracy becomes important when the lens projected velocity
v is of order vj. For events toward the Large Magellanic
Cloud, vj{\textasciitilde}=(3/4)v⊕, so this degeneracy is
important primarily for lenses in the Milky Way disk. In particular, it
solves the puzzle of MACHO-LMC-5, whose microlens parallax measurement
had yielded mass and distance determinations for the lens that were
inconsistent with photometric estimates. Toward the Galactic bulge,
vj ranges from {\textasciitilde}0.2 km s- 1 at the summer solstice
to {\textasciitilde}200 km s- 1 at the equinoxes , so the effect of the
degeneracy depends strongly on the peak time of the event. The

We show that short events are aﬀected signiﬁcantly by source blending and that, for moderately blended sources, the optical depth τ is globally overestimated, because of an underestimation of the exposure. For high blending situations, on the other hand, blending leads to an underestimation of the optical depth. Our results are in agreement with the most recent optical depth determinations toward the Galactic Center of the MACHO and OGLE-II collaborations that use clump giants (less aﬀected by the blending eﬀect) as sources. The blending-corrected, lower optical depth toward the Galactic Bulge is now in good agreement with the value inferred from galactic models, reconciling theoretical and observational determinations.},

In this paper, we report three strong candidate BD-lens events found from the search for lensing events not only with short timescales (\$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm E\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 6{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm days\}\$) but also with very small angular Einstein radii (\${\textbackslash}theta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm E\}{\textbackslash}lesssim 0.05{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm mas\}\$) among the events that have been found in the 2016--2019 observing seasons. These events include MOA-2017-BLG-147, MOA-2017-BLG-241, and MOA-2019-BLG-256, in which the first two events are produced by single lenses and the last event is produced by a binary lens. From the Bayesian analysis conducted with the combined \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm E\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}theta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm E\}\$ constraint, it is estimated that the lens masses of the individual events are \$0.051{\textasciicircum}\{+0.100\}\_\{-0.027\}{\textasciitilde}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, \$0.044{\textasciicircum}\{+0.090\}\_\{-0.023\}{\textasciitilde}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, and \$0.046{\textasciicircum}\{+0.067\}\_\{-0.023\}{\textasciitilde}M\_{\textbackslash}odot/0.038{\textasciicircum}\{+0.056\}\_\{-0.019\}{\textasciitilde}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and the probability of the lens mass smaller than the lower limit of stars is \${\textbackslash}sim 80{\textbackslash}\%\$ for all events. We point out that routine lens mass measurements of short time-scale lensing events require survey-mode space-based observations.},

	abstract = {We present the details of the Bayesian analysis on the planetary microlensing event MOA-2016-BLG-227, whose excess flux is likely due to a source/lens companion or an unrelated ambient star, as well as of the assumed prior distributions. Furthermore, we apply this method to four reported planetary events, MOA-2008-BLG-310, MOA-2011-BLG-293, OGLE-2012-BLG-0527, and OGLE-2012-BLG-0950, where adaptive optics observations have detected excess flux at the source star positions. For events with small angular Einstein radii, our lens mass estimates are more uncertain than those of previous analyses who assumed that the excess was due to the lens. Our predictions for MOA-2008-BLG-310 and OGLE-2012-BLG-0950 are consistent with recent results on these events obtained via Keck and Hubble Space Telescope observations when the source star is resolvable from the lens star. For events with small angular Einstein radii, we find that it is generally difficult to conclude whether the excess flux comes from the host star. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the lens star by measuring its proper motion relative to the source star to determine whether the excess flux comes from the lens star. Even without such measurements, our method can be used to statistically test the dependence of the planet-hosting probability on the stellar mass. Moreover, we find a discrepancy between the detected number of planetary events in a stellar binary system and our predicted number, which might indicate lower stellar companion frequency in a planetary system and/or the existence of several missed binary and planet events thus far.},

This method is illustrated using two example problems from the field of gravitational wave astronomy.},

	abstract = {Accurately characterizing the redshift distributions of galaxies is essential for analysing deep photometric surveys and testing cosmological models. We present a technique to simultaneously infer redshift distributions and individual redshifts from photometric galaxy catalogues. Our model constructs a piecewise constant representation (effectively a histogram) of the distribution of galaxy types and redshifts, the parameters of which are efﬁciently inferred from noisy photometric ﬂux measurements. This approach can be seen as a generalization of template-ﬁtting photometric redshift methods and relies on a library of spectral templates to relate the photometric ﬂuxes of individual galaxies to their redshifts. We illustrate this technique on simulated galaxy survey data, and demonstrate that it delivers correct posterior distributions on the underlying type and redshift distributions, as well as on the individual types and redshifts of galaxies. We show that even with uninformative priors, large photometric errors and parameter degeneracies, the redshift and type distributions can be recovered robustly thanks to the hierarchical nature of the model, which is not possible with common photometric redshift estimation techniques. As a result, redshift uncertainties can be fully propagated in cosmological analyses for the ﬁrst time, fulﬁlling an essential requirement for the current and future generations of surveys.},

Variable candidates are selected depending on how strongly they are separated from the largest cluster and how rarely they are grouped together in eight-dimensional space spanned by variability indices. All NSVS light curves are also cross-correlated with IRAS, AKARI, Two Micron All Sky Survey, Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and GALEX objects, as well as known objects in the SIMBAD database. The variability analysis and cross-correlation results are provided in a public online database, which can be used to select interesting objects for further investigation. Adopting conservative selection criteria for variable candidates, we ﬁnd about 1.8 million light curves as possible variable candidates in the NSVS data, corresponding to about 10\% of our entire NSVS sample. Multi-wavelength colors help us ﬁnd speciﬁc types of variability among the variable candidates. Moreover, we also use morphological classiﬁcation from other surveys such as SDSS to suppress spurious cases caused by blending objects or extended sources due to the low angular resolution of the NSVS.},

Variations in the light curves are described in terms of nine variability features that are complementary to each other. We consider three different clustering methods based on Gaussian mixture models, including one that was used in our previous work, assuming that real variable candidates can be found as minor clusters and at a distant from major clusters, which correspond to nonvariable objects. The three different methods with a broad level of speed and precision prove that we can select a suitable method for detecting variable light curves, depending on the speed and precision constraints on clustering. We also consider a consensus clustering method that combines clustering results obtained using multiple clustering methods. The consensus clustering method improves the reliability of detecting variable candidates by combining information that is learned from a given data set by multiple methods. As a complete variability analysis of the public SuperWASP light curves, we provide clustering results obtained by using an inﬁnite Gaussian mixture model in the framework of variational Bayesian inference, as well as variability indices of the light curves in an online database to help others exploit the SuperWASP data.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference involves two main computational challenges. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the posterior distribution may well be highly multi-modal: a regime in which the convergence to stationarity of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques becomes incredibly slow. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models the necessary estimation of the Bayesian evidence for each is, by definition, a (possibly high-dimensional) integration over the entire parameter space; again this can be a daunting computational task, although new Monte Carlo (MC) integration algorithms offer solutions of ever increasing efficiency. Nested sampling (NS) is one such contemporary MC strategy targeted at calculation of the Bayesian evidence, but which also enables posterior inference as a by-product, thereby allowing simultaneous parameter estimation and model selection. The widely-used MultiNest algorithm presents a particularly efficient implementation of the NS technique for multi-modal posteriors. In this paper we discuss importance nested sampling (INS), an alternative summation of the MultiNest draws, which can calculate the Bayesian evidence at up to an order of magnitude higher accuracy than `vanilla' NS with no change in the way MultiNest explores the parameter space. This is accomplished by treating as a (pseudo-)importance sample the totality of points collected by MultiNest, including those previously discarded under the constrained likelihood sampling of the NS algorithm. We apply this technique to several challenging test problems and compare the accuracy of Bayesian evidences obtained with INS against those from vanilla NS.},

From the perspective of modern statistics, such corrections arise naturally in the context of multilevel models, particularly in Bayesian treatments of such models: hierarchical Bayesian models. We survey some key lessons from hierarchical Bayesian modeling, including shrinkage estimation, which is closely related to traditional corrections devised by astronomers. We describe a framework for hierarchical Bayesian modeling of cosmic populations, tailored to features of astronomical surveys that are not typical of surveys in other disciplines. This thinned latent marked point process framework accounts for the tie between selection (detection) and measurement in astronomical surveys, treating selection and measurement error eﬀects in a self-consistent manner.},

Analysis of the light curve based on single-lens single-source (1L1S) modeling yields very small values of the event timescale, tE ∼ 3.5 days, and the angular Einstein radius, θE ∼ 0.009 mas, making the lens a candidate of a free-ﬂoating planet. Close inspection reveals that the 1L1S solution leaves small residuals with amplitude ∆I 0.03 mag. We ﬁnd that the residuals are explained by the existence of an additional widely-separated heavier lens component, indicating that the lens is a wide-separation planetary system rather than a free-ﬂoating planet.

	abstract = {We report the lens mass and distance measurements of the nearby microlensing event TCP J05074264+2447555. We measure the microlens parallax vector πE using Spitzer and ground-based light curves with constraints on the direction of lens-source relative proper motion derived from Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) GRAVITY observations. Combining this πE determination with the angular Einstein radius θE measured by VLTI GRAVITY observations, we ﬁnd that the lens is a star with mass M = 0.495 ± 0.063 M at a distance DL = 429 ± 21 pc. We ﬁnd that the blended light basically all comes from the lens. The lenssource proper motion is µrel,hel = 26.55 ± 0.36 mas yr−1, so with currently available adaptive-optics (AO) instruments, the lens and source can be resolved in 2021. This is the ﬁrst microlensing event whose lens mass is unambiguously measured by interferometry + satellite parallax observations, which opens a new window for mass measurements of isolated objects such as stellar-mass black holes.},

Here, we present the overall technical specifications of the KMTNet observation system, test observation results, data transfer and image processing procedure, and finally, the KMTNet science programs. The system consists of three 1.6 m wide-field optical telescopes equipped with mosaic CCD cameras of 18k by 18k pixels. Each telescope provides a 2.0 by 2.0 square degree field of view. We have finished installing all three telescopes and cameras sequentially at the Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile, the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in South Africa, and the Siding Spring Observatory (SSO) in Australia. This network of telescopes, which is spread over three different continents at a similar latitude of about -30 degrees, enables 24-hour continuous monitoring of targets observable in the Southern Hemisphere. The test observations showed good image quality that meets the seeing requirement of less than 1.0 arcsec in I-band. All of the observation data are transferred to the KMTNet data center at KASI via the international network communication and are processed with the KMTNet data pipeline. The primary scientific goal of the KMTNet is to discover numerous extrasolar planets toward the Galactic bulge by using the gravitational microlensing technique, especially earth-mass planets in the habitable zone. During the non-bulge season, the system is used for wide-field photometric survey science on supernovae, asteroids, and external galaxies. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In the history of astronomy, major advances in our understanding of the Universe have come from dramatic improvements in our ability to accurately measure astronomical quantities. Aided by rapid progress in information technology, current sky surveys are changing the way we view and study the Universe. Next-generation surveys will maintain this revolutionary progress. We focus here on the most ambitious survey currently planned in the visible band, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). LSST will have unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: constraining dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. It will be a large, wide-field ground-based system designed to obtain multiple images covering the sky that is visible from Cerro Pachón in Northern Chile. The current baseline design, with an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} field of view, and a 3,200 Megapixel camera, will allow about 10,000 square degrees of sky to be covered using pairs of 15-second exposures in two photometric bands every three nights on average. The system is designed to yield high image quality, as well as superb astrometric and photometric accuracy. The survey area will include 30,000 deg{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} with δ\&lt;+34.5°, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, ugrizy, covering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will observe a 20,000 deg{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} region about 1000 times in the six bands during the anticipated 10 years of operation. These data will result in databases including 10 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and will serve the majority of science programs. The remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to special programs such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys. We describe how the LSST science drivers led to these choices of system parameters.},

Most of these are gravitationally bound to their host stars. There is some evidence of free-floating planetary-mass objects in young star-forming regions, but these objects are limited to massive objects of 3 to 15 Jupiter masses with large uncertainties in photometric mass estimates and their abundance. Here, we report the discovery of a population of unbound or distant Jupiter-mass objects, which are almost twice () as common as main-sequence stars, based on two years of gravitational microlensing survey observations towards the Galactic Bulge. These planetary-mass objects have no host stars that can be detected within about ten astronomical units by gravitational microlensing. However, a comparison with constraints from direct imaging suggests that most of these planetary-mass objects are not bound to any host star. An abrupt change in the mass function at about one Jupiter mass favours the idea that their formation process is different from that of stars and brown dwarfs. They may have formed in proto-planetary disks and subsequently scattered into unbound or very distant orbits.},

Przemek Mróz et al. have now analysed a much larger sample of microlensing events and place an upper limit, at two standard deviations, on the population of free-floating Jupiter-mass planets that is almost a factor of ten lower than the previous claim, thereby essentially ruling out the existence of this particular population. They do, however, see a few very short events, which, on the basis of the theories of planet formation, indicate the existence of free-floating Earth-mass planets.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by ﬁrst-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC’s performance is highly sensitive to two user-speciﬁed parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as eﬃciently as (and sometimes more eﬃciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the ﬂy based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require eﬃcient “turnkey” samplers.},

While instrumental systematics can be reduced using methods such as pixel level decorrelation, removing stellar trends while preserving transit signals proves challenging. As a result of vast archives of light curves from recent transit surveys, there is a strong need for accurate automatic detrending, without human intervention. A large variety of detrending algorithms are in active use, but their comparative performance for transit discovery is unexplored. We benchmark all commonly used detrending methods against hundreds of Kepler, K2, and TESS planets, selected to represent the most difﬁcult cases for systems with small planet-to-star radius ratios. The full parameter range is explored for each method to determine the best choices for planet discovery. We conclude that the ideal method is a timewindowed slider with an iterative robust location estimator based on Tukey’s biweight. This method recovers 99\% and 94\% of the shallowest Kepler and K2 planets, respectively. We include an additional analysis for young stars with extreme variability and conclude they are best treated using a spline-based method with a robust Huber estimator. All stellar detrending methods explored are available for public use in Wōtan, an open-source Python package on GitHub (https://github.com/hippke/wotan).},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian dynamics can be used to produce distant proposals for the Metropolis algorithm, thereby avoiding the slow exploration of the state space that results from the diffusive behaviour of simple random-walk proposals. Though originating in physics, Hamiltonian dynamics can be applied to most problems with continuous state spaces by simply introducing fictitious "momentum" variables. A key to its usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume, and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex mappings without the need to account for a hard-to-compute Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time. In this review, I discuss theoretical and practical aspects of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its variations, including using windows of states for deciding on acceptance or rejection, computing trajectories using fast approximations, tempering during the course of a trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods that prevent useless trajectories from taking much computation time.},

	abstract = {Summary. The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis–Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain. The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from http://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a powerful Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for performing approximate inference in complex probabilistic models of continuous variables. In common with many MCMC methods, however, the standard HMC approach performs poorly in distributions with multiple isolated modes. We present a method for augmenting the Hamiltonian system with an extra continuous temperature control variable which allows the dynamic to bridge between sampling a complex target distribution and a simpler unimodal base distribution. This augmentation both helps improve mixing in multimodal targets and allows the normalisation constant of the target distribution to be estimated. The method is simple to implement within existing HMC code, requiring only a standard leapfrog integrator. We demonstrate experimentally that the method is competitive with annealed importance sampling and simulating tempering methods at sampling from challenging multimodal distributions and estimating their normalising constants.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is an efficient Bayesian sampling method that can make distant proposals in the parameter space by simulating a Hamiltonian dynamical system. Despite its popularity in machine learning and data science, HMC is inefficient to sample from spiky and multimodal distributions. Motivated by the energy-time uncertainty relation from quantum mechanics, we propose a Quantum-Inspired Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm (QHMC). This algorithm allows a particle to have a random mass with a probability distribution rather than a fixed mass. We prove the convergence property of QHMC in the spatial domain and in the time sequence. We further show why such a random mass can improve the performance when we sample a broad class of distributions. In order to handle the big training data sets in large-scale machine learning, we develop a stochastic gradient version of QHMC using Nos{\textbackslash}'e-Hoover thermostat called QSGNHT, and we also provide theoretical justifications about its steady-state distributions. Finally in the experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of QHMC and QSGNHT on synthetic examples, bridge regression, image denoising and neural network pruning. The proposed QHMC and QSGNHT can indeed achieve much more stable and accurate sampling results on the test cases.},

Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

	abstract = {We present a new Milky Way microlensing simulation code, dubbed PopSyCLE (Population Synthesis for Compact object Lensing Events). PopSyCLE is the first resolved microlensing simulation to include a compact object distribution derived from numerical supernovae explosion models and both astrometric and photometric microlensing effects. We demonstrate the capabilities of PopSyCLE by investigating the optimal way to find black holes (BHs) with microlensing. Candidate BHs have typically been selected from wide-field photometric microlensing surveys, such as OGLE, by selecting events with long Einstein crossing times (\$t\_E{\textgreater}120\$ days). These events can be selected at closest approach and monitored astrometrically in order to constrain the mass of each lens; PopSyCLE predicts a BH detection rate of {\textasciitilde}40\% for such a program. We find that the detection rate can be enhanced to {\textasciitilde}85\% by selecting events with both \$t\_E{\textgreater}120\$ days and a microlensing parallax of \${\textbackslash}pi\_E{\textless}0.08\$. Unfortunately, such a selection criterion cannot be applied during the event as \${\textbackslash}pi\_E\$ requires both pre- and post-peak photometry. However, historical microlensing events from photometric surveys can be revisited using this new selection criteria in order to statistically constrain the abundance of BHs in the Milky Way. The future WFIRST microlensing survey provides both precise photometry and astrometry and will yield individual masses of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(100-1000) black holes, which is at least an order of magnitude more than is possible with individual candidate follow-up with current facilities. The resulting sample of BH masses from WFIRST will begin to constrain the shape of the black hole present-day mass function, BH multiplicity, and BH kick velocity distributions.},

These events were selected because of their long durations, which statistically favors more massive lenses. Astrometric measurements were made over one to two years using laser-guided adaptive optics observations from the W. M. Keck Observatory. Lens model parameters were first constrained by the photometric light curves. The OB120169 light curve is well fit by a single-lens model, while both OB110022 and OB110125 light curves favor binary lens models. Using the photometric fits as prior information, no significant astrometric lensing signal was detected and all targets were consistent with linear motion. The significant lack of astrometric signal constrains the lens mass of OB110022 to 0.05–1.79 M ⊙ in a 99.7\% confidence interval, which disfavors a BH lens. Fits to OB110125 yielded a reduced Einstein crossing time and insufficient observations during the peak, so no mass limits were obtained. Two degenerate solutions exist for OB120169, which have a lens mass between 0.2–38.8 M ⊙ and 0.4–39.8 M ⊙ for a 99.7\% confidence interval. Follow-up observations of OB120169 will further constrain the lens mass. Based on our experience, we use simulations to design optimal astrometric observing strategies and show that with more typical observing conditions the detection of BHs is feasible.},

The search pipeline uses machine learning algorithms to help ﬁnd rare phenomena among 150 million objects and to derive the detection efﬁciency. Applications of the catalog can be numerous, from analyzing individual events to large statistical studies of the Galactic mass, kinematics distributions, and planetary abundances. We derive maps of the mean Einstein ring crossing time of events spanning 31 deg2 toward the Galactic center and compare the observed distributions with the most recent models. We ﬁnd good agreement within the observed region and we see the signature of the tilt of the bar in the microlensing data. However, the asymmetry of the mean timescales seems to rise more steeply than predicted, indicating either a somewhat different orientation of the bar or a larger bar width. The map of events with sources in the Galactic bulge shows a dependence of the mean timescale on the Galactic latitude, signaling an increasing contribution from disk lenses closer to the plane relative to the height of the disk. Our data present a perfect set for comparing and enhancing new models of the central parts of the Milky Way and creating a three-dimensional picture of the Galaxy.},

	title = {Constraining the masses of microlensing black holes and the mass gap with {Gaia} {DR2}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07789},
	abstract = {Context: Gravitational microlensing is sensitive to compact-object lenses in the Milky Way, including white dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes, and could potentially probe a wide range of stellar remnant masses. However, the mass of the lens can be determined only in very limited cases, due to missing information on both source and lens distances and their proper motions. Aims: We aim at improving the mass estimates in the annual parallax microlensing events found in the 8 years of OGLE-III observations towards the Galactic Bulge (Wyrzykowski et al. 2016) with the use of Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2). Methods: We use Gaia DR2 data on distances and proper motions of non-blended sources and recompute the masses of lenses in parallax events. We also identify new events in that sample which are likely to have dark lens; the total number of such events is now 18. Results: The derived distribution of masses of dark lenses is consistent with a continuous distribution of stellar remnant masses. A mass gap between neutron-star and black-hole masses in the range between 2 and 5 solar masses is not favoured by our data, unless black holes receive natal-kicks above 20-80 km/s. We present 8 candidates for objects with masses within the putative mass gap, including a spectacular multi-peak parallax event with mass of \$2.4{\textasciicircum}\{+1.9\}\_\{-1.3\}{\textbackslash} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ located just at 600 pc. The absence of an observational mass gap between neutron stars and black holes, or, conversely, the evidence for black hole natal kicks if a mass gap is assumed, can inform future supernova modelling efforts.},

The LSST’s large ﬁeld of view and aperture allow effective time-series observations of many stars in the Galactic disk and bulge. Here, we combine Galactic models (for ∣b∣ {\textless} 10) and simulations of LSST observations to study how observing strategies affect the number and properties of microlensing events detected by LSST. Generally, detectable microlensing events are (a little) longer than events observable with current surveys. In Galactic bulge ﬁelds, LSST should detect on the order of 600 microlensing events per square degree as compared to 19 in disk ﬁelds. Improving the cadence from 6 to 2 days approximately doubles the number of detectable microlensing events throughout the Galaxy. We develop an Operations Simulator (OpSim)–based simulation to predict the characteristics of detectable microlensing events in different OpSim strategies and compare them. Based on baseline\_2018a, minion\_1016, and colossus\_2664 OpSim simulations, LSST will observe with either 900 or 170 epochs in different observing times and cadences. With worse cadences LSST will detect longer microlensing events of brighter stars with lower blending. Although increasing the observing time from 1 to 10 yr with a ﬁxed number of epochs does not change the total number of microlensing events signiﬁcantly, the longer observing time lets one discern artiﬁcial effects and measure baseline ﬂuxes, parallax, etc. If LSST spends enough time observing near the Galactic plane, then the large number of microlensing events will allow studies of the Galactic distribution of planets and searches for isolated black holes among a wealth of other scientiﬁc cases.},

We predict that at the end of the nominal 5 yr of the Gaia mission, for the events brighter than G ≈ 15.5 mag at the baseline, caused by objects heavier than 10 M , it will be possible to unambiguously derive masses of the lenses, with accuracy between a few and 15 per cent. We ﬁnd that fainter events (G {\textless} 17.5) can still have their lens masses determined, provided that they are heavier than 30 M . We estimate that the rate of astrometric microlensing events caused by the stellar-origin black holes is ≈4 × 10−7 yr−1, which implies, that after 5 yr of Gaia operation and ≈5 × 106 bright sources in Gaia, it will be possible to identify few such events in the Gaia ﬁnal catalogues.},

We dispute this argument by showing that the empirical Fisher---unlike the Fisher---does not generally capture second-order information. We further argue that the conditions under which the empirical Fisher approaches the Fisher (and the Hessian) are unlikely to be met in practice, and that, even on simple optimization problems, the pathologies of the empirical Fisher can have undesirable effects.},

	abstract = {Standard Bayesian inference is known to be sensitive to model misspecification, leading to unreliable uncertainty quantification and poor predictive performance. However, finding generally applicable and computationally feasible methods for robust Bayesian inference under misspecification has proven to be a difficult challenge. An intriguing, easy-to-use, and widely applicable approach is to use bagging on the Bayesian posterior ("BayesBag"); that is, to use the average of posterior distributions conditioned on bootstrapped datasets. In this paper, we comprehensively develop the asymptotic theory of BayesBag, propose a model--data mismatch index for model criticism using BayesBag, and empirically validate our theory and methodology on synthetic and real-world data in linear regression (both feature selection and parameter inference), sparse logistic regression, insurance loss prediction, and phylogenetic tree reconstruction. We find that in the presence of significant misspecification, BayesBag yields more reproducible inferences, has better predictive accuracy, and selects correct models more often than the standard Bayesian posterior; meanwhile, when the model is correctly specified, BayesBag produces superior or equally good results for parameter inference and prediction, while being slightly more conservative for model selection. Overall, our results demonstrate that BayesBag combines the attractive modeling features of standard Bayesian inference with the distributional robustness properties of frequentist methods, providing benefits over both Bayes alone and the bootstrap alone.},

In particular, precise measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Galactic bulge enable strict tests of competing models of the Milky Way. Previous estimates, based on samples of up to a few hundred events, gave larger values than expected from the Galactic models and were difﬁcult to reconcile with other constraints on the Galactic structure. Here we used long-term photometric observations of the Galactic bulge by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to select a homogeneous sample of 8000 gravitational microlensing events. We created the largest and most accurate microlensing optical depth and event rate maps of the Galactic bulge. The new maps ease the tension between the previous measurements and Galactic models. They are consistent with some earlier calculations based on bright stars and are systematically ∼30\% smaller than the other estimates based on “all-source” samples of microlensing events. The difference is caused by the careful estimation of the source star population. The new maps agree well with predictions based on the Besançon model of the Galaxy. Apart from testing the Milky Way models, our maps may have numerous other applications, such as the measurement of the initial mass function or constraining the dark matter content in the Milky Way center. The new maps will also inform the planning of future space-based microlensing experiments by revising the expected number of events.},

	abstract = {With their excellent photometric precision and dramatic increase in monitoring frequency, future microlensing survey experiments are expected to be sensitive to very short timescale, isolated events caused by free-ﬂoating and wide-separation planets with masses as low as a few lunar masses. The scientiﬁc value of these detections would be greatly enhanced if their nature (bound or unbound) could be accurately characterized and if the planet masses could be measured. Here we present a comprehensive discussion of the ability of microlensing to detect and characterize wide-separation planets. We estimate the probability of measuring the planetary Einstein radius  E, p for bound and free-ﬂoating planets; this is one of the two additional observables required to measure the planet mass. We carry out detailed simulations of the planetary events expected in next-generation surveys and estimate the resulting uncertainty in  E, p for these events. We show that, for main-sequence sources and Jupiter-mass planets, the caustic structure of wide-separation planets with projected separations of P20 AU substantially increases the probability of measuring the dimensionless source size and thus determining  E, p compared to the case of unbound planets. In this limit where the source is much smaller than the caustic, the effective cross section to measure  E, p to 10\% is \$25\% larger than the full width of the caustic. Measurement of the lens parallax is possible for low-mass planetary events through combined observations from the ground and a satellite located in an L2 orbit; this would complete the mass measurements for such wide-separation planets. Finally, short-duration events caused by bound planets can be routinely distinguished from those caused by free-ﬂoating planets for planet-star separations P20 AU from either the deviations due to the planetary caustic or (more often) the low-amplitude bump from the magniﬁcation due to the parent star.},

In estimating the probability, we consider the variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity deﬁned as the ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the photometric precision. From this investigation, we ﬁnd results consistent with previous studies that the probability increases with the increase of the magniﬁcation. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magniﬁcation at which perturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We ﬁnd this boost occurs at moderate magniﬁcations of A P 20, implying that probability can be high even for events with moderate magniﬁcations. The probability increases as the source brightness increases. We ﬁnd that the probability of events associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even at magniﬁcations as low as A \$ 5. In the absence of the rare prime target of very high magniﬁcation events, we therefore recommend to observe events with the brightest source stars and highest magniﬁcations among the alerted events. Because of the increase of the source size with the increase of the brightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain magniﬁcation, causing detections of low mass ratio planets (q P 10À4) that are difﬁcult from the observations of events involved with giant stars with magniﬁcations A k 70.},

Standard leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) requires the likelihood to be factorizable, but many important models in temporal and spatial statistics do not have this property. We derive how to compute and validate both exact and approximate LOO-CV for Bayesian non-factorizable models with a multivariate normal likelihood.

	abstract = {One of the common goals of time series analysis is to use the observed series to inform predictions for future observations. In the absence of any actual new data to predict, cross-validation can be used to estimate a model’s future predictive accuracy, for instance, for the purpose of model comparison or selection. Exact cross-validation for Bayesian models is often computationally expensive, but approximate cross-validation methods have been developed, most notably methods for leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV). If the actual prediction task is to predict the future given the past, LOO-CV provides an overly optimistic estimate because the information from future observations is available to inﬂuence predictions of the past. To properly account for the time series structure, we can use leave-future-out cross-validation (LFO-CV). Like exact LOO-CV, exact LFO-CV requires reﬁtting the model many times to diﬀerent subsets of the data. Using Pareto smoothed importance sampling, we propose a method for approximating exact LFO-CV that drastically reduces the computational costs while also providing informative diagnostics about the quality of the approximation.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an eﬃcient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the ﬁnite case with weak priors or inﬂuential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models.

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

	abstract = {Lambert's model for body reflection is widely used in computer graphics. It is used extensively by rendering techniques such as radiosity and ray tracing. For several real-world objects, however, Lambert's model can prove to be a very inaccurate approximation to the body reflectance. While the brightness of a Lambertian surface is independent of viewing direction, that of a rough surface increases as the viewing direction approaches the light source direction. In this paper, a comprehensive model is developed that predicts body reflectance from rough surfaces. The surface is modeled as a collection of Lambertian facets. It is shown that such a surface is inherently non-Lambertian due to the foreshortening of the surface facets. Further, the model accounts for complex geometric and radiometric phenomena such as masking, shadowing, and interreflections between facets. Several experiments have been conducted on samples of rough diffuse surfaces, such as, plaster, sand, clay, and cloth. All these surface demonstrate significant deviation from Lambertian behavior. The reflectance measurements obtained are in strong agreement with the reflectance predicted by the model.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02609},
	abstract = {We propose a new Monte Carlo method for sampling from multimodal distributions. The idea of this technique is based on splitting the task into two: finding the modes of a target distribution \${\textbackslash}pi\$ and sampling, given the knowledge of the locations of the modes. The sampling algorithm relies on steps of two types: local ones, preserving the mode; and jumps to regions associated with different modes. Besides, the method learns the optimal parameters of the algorithm while it runs, without requiring user intervention. Our technique should be considered as a flexible framework, in which the design of moves can follow various strategies known from the broad MCMC literature. In order to design an adaptive scheme that facilitates both local and jump moves, we introduce an auxiliary variable representing each mode and we define a new target distribution \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}pi\}\$ on an augmented state space \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{X\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}times{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{X\}\$ is the original state space of \${\textbackslash}pi\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\$ is the set of the modes. As the algorithm runs and updates its parameters, the target distribution \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}pi\}\$ also keeps being modified. This motivates a new class of algorithms, Auxiliary Variable Adaptive MCMC. We prove general ergodic results for the whole class before specialising to the case of our algorithm.},

	abstract = {Many problems in contemporary astrophysics---from understanding the formation of black holes to untangling the chemical evolution of galaxies---rely on knowledge about binary stars. This, in turn, depends on discovery and characterization of binary companions for large numbers of different kinds of stars in different chemical and dynamical environments. Current stellar spectroscopic surveys observe hundreds of thousands to millions of stars with (typically) few observational epochs, which allows binary discovery but makes orbital characterization challenging. We use a custom Monte Carlo sampler (The Joker) to perform discovery and characterization of binary systems through radial-velocities, in the regime of sparse, noisy, and poorly sampled multi-epoch data. We use it to generate posterior samplings in Keplerian parameters for 232,531 sources released in APOGEE Data Release 16. Our final catalog contains 19,635 high-confidence close-binary (P {\textless} few years, a {\textless} few AU) systems that show interesting relationships between binary occurrence rate and location in the color-magnitude diagram. We find notable faint companions at high masses (black-hole candidates), at low masses (substellar candidates), and at very close separations (mass-transfer candidates). We also use the posterior samplings in a (toy) hierarchical inference to measure the long-period binary-star eccentricity distribution. We release the full set of posterior samplings for the entire parent sample of 232,531 stars. This set of samplings involves no heuristic "discovery" threshold and therefore can be used for myriad statistical purposes, including hierarchical inferences about binary-star populations and sub-threshold searches.},

	abstract = {Between 1999 and 2002, the Galileo spacecraft made 6 close flybys of Io during which many observations of Io's thermal radiation were made with the photopolarimeter–radiometer (PPR). While the NIMS instrument could measure thermal emission from hot spots with T{\textgreater}200 K, PPR was the only Galileo instrument capable of mapping the lower temperatures of older, cooling lava flows, and the passive background. We tabulate all data taken by PPR of Io during these flybys and describe some scientific highlights revealed by the data. The data include almost complete coverage of Io at better than 250 km resolution, with extensive regional coverage at higher resolutions. We found a modest poleward drop in nighttime background temperatures and evidence of thermal inertia variations across the surface. Comparison of high spatial resolution temperature measurements with observed daytime SO2 gas pressures on Io provides evidence for local cold trapping of SO2 frost on scales smaller than the 60 km resolution of the PPR data. We also calculated the power output from several hot spots and estimated total global heat flow to be about 2.0–2.6 Wm−2. The low-latitude diurnal temperature variations for the regions between obvious hot spots are well matched by a laterally-inhomogeneous thermal model with less than 1 Wm−2 endogenic heat flow.},

	abstract = {We present a map of Io’s volcanic heat ﬂow. Io’s high heat ﬂow is a result of intense tidal heating, which generates widespread volcanic activity. The surface expression of ongoing volcanic activity constrains the location and magnitude of tidal dissipation within Io. Tidal heating models place heating either at relatively shallow (aesthenosphere) levels, or deep in the mantle. It was thought that actual tidal heating could be approximated using a combination of these end-member models. Io’s volcanic heat ﬂow has now been mapped in sufﬁcient detail to compare with the models. Our maps show that the distribution of heat ﬂow is not matched by current models of deep nor shallow tidal heating, nor by any combination of these two models. We ﬁnd relatively low heat ﬂow at sub-jovian (0°W) and anti-jovian (180°W) longitudes, at odds with the pure aesthenospheric heating model. Furthermore, there are large swaths of Io’s surface where there is poor correlation between the number of hot spots in an area and the power emitted. We have previously accounted for \%54\% of Io’s observed heat ﬂow. We now show that Io’s anomalously warm poles, possibly the result of heat ﬂow from deep-mantle heating, would yield the ‘‘missing” energy (48 TW) if the polar surfaces are at temperatures of \$90 K to \$95 K and cover latitudes above \$43° to \$48° respectively. This possibility implies a ratio of deep to shallow heating of about 1:1. However, explaining regional variations in surface volcanic activity requires more detailed modeling of the location and magnitude of the internal tidal dissipation and the consequences of mantle convection and advection within Io. Future model predictions can be compared to our heat ﬂow map.},

	abstract = {Jupiter’s moon Io is a dynamic target, exhibiting extreme and time-variable volcanic activity powered by tidal forcing from Jupiter. We have conducted a campaign of high-cadence observations of Io with the goal of characterizing its volcanic activity. Between Aug 2013 and the end of 2015, we imaged Io on 100 nights in the near-infrared with adaptive optics on the Keck and Gemini N telescopes, which resolve emission from individual volcanic hot spots. During our program, we made over 400 detections of 48 distinct hot spots, some of which were detected 30+ times. We use these observations to derive a timeline of global volcanic activity on Io, which exhibits wide variability from month to month. The timelines of thermal activity at individual volcanic centers have geophysical implications, and will permit future characterization by others. We evaluate hot spot detection limits and give a simple parameterization of the minimum detectable intensity as a function of emission angle, which can be applied to other analyses. We detected three outburst eruptions in August 2013, but no other outburst-scale events were observed in the subsequent ∼90 observations. Either the cluster of events in August 2013 was a rare occurrence, or there is a mechanism causing large events to occur closely-spaced in time. We also detected large eruptions (though not of outburst scale) within days of one another at Kurdalagon Patera and Sethlaus/Gabija Paterae in 2015. As was also seen in the Galileo dataset, the hot spots we detected can be separated into two categories based on their thermal emission: those that are persistently active for 1 year or more at moderate intensity, and those that are only brieﬂy active, are time-variable, and often reach large intensities. A small number of hot spots in the latter category appear and subside in a matter of days, reaching particularly high intensities; although these are not bright enough to qualify as outbursts, their thermal signatures follow the same pattern, suggesting that a similar mechanism may be responsible for these events though at a smaller scale.},

	abstract = {During the winter of 1991 an unusually favorable series of occultations of Io by Europa took place. We obtained infrared photometry of four of these events at the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope at wavelengths of 5.0 or 3.4 μm, in order to investigate the nature and distribution of volcanism on Io by observing the occultation of the volcanic hot spots by the limb of Europa. Observations at 3.4 μm on 1991/01/08 detected a possible small hot spot in the northern hemisphere. Observations at 5.0 μm on 1991/02/27 detected and resolved the major hot spot Loki, which had a diameter of 170 km and had three times its Voyager 1 flux, and also detected the Voyager hot spot Pele at about half its Voyager 1 flux. A 5.0-μm occultation of Pele on 1991/03/06, when Loki was not occulted, indicated no significant flux change since the week before. Infrared images of Io obtained at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility between October 1990 and April 1991 show that the Europa occultations occurred during a period of unusually high activity at Loki. Loki showed very little thermal emission in observations between 1990/10/12 and 1990/11/27, but increased in flux by a factor of 10 in 32 days by 1991/12/29. Loki then remained bright in all observations until 1991/03/26, but had begun to fade on 1991/04/09. Such rapid variations in flux over such a large area are remarkable. Multiwavelength observations indicate that Loki increased in temperature during the brightening, and that materials hotter than 630 K were exposed at Loki. The possible "Pele-type" volcanoes Surt and Aten, unlike Pele, were not detected, with 3.8 μm flux upper limits of about 8 GW μm-1 str-1.},

	abstract = {Jupiter's moon Io possesses numerous tectonic mountains in addition to its ubiquitous volcanoes and volcanic features. Remarkably, a distinct global anticorrelation exists between the spatial distribution of mountains and volcanic centers on Io. This relationship indicates an explicit connection between volcanism and mountain formation, even though the mountains are tectonic in origin (predominantly upthrusted crustal blocks). Spherical harmonic analysis shows the distribution of mountains and volcanic centers have statistically signiﬁcant power at degree 2; this result is especially striking for the volcanic center distribution, and directly implicates models of asthenospheric tidal heating. The latter predict enhanced heat ﬂux along the equator in a degree-two pattern that matches observations. Mountain formation on Io appears to be a form of dominantly vertical tectonism unique in the modern Solar System: continual burial by widespread volcanism drives the crust inward, which leads to strong compression, and at discrete locations, mountains. Correlation coefﬁcients between the volcanic and mountain distributions indicate statistically meaningful anticorrelation at low spectral degrees (l = 1, 2, 4, and 6); the anticorrelation is especially signiﬁcant between the longitudinal (sectorial) l = 2 components when considered on their own. We compare this anticorrelation with published models that link volcano and mountain formation. While consistent in part with l = 2 convection models, which predict such an anticorrelation (in principle), such low degree anticorrelations are also (if not more) compatible with mountain formation due to, or inﬂuenced by, thermal expansion of Io's crust, and deep compression and thrust faulting in regions of lower than average volcanic heat-piping. Positive correlations between mountain and volcanic center distributions at high spectral degree may reﬂect structural links between a good fraction of mountain blocks and adjacent volcanic paterae, whereas the anticorrelation at low degree implies that most volcanic features (which are far more numerous overall) form independently of mountains.},

	abstract = {The widespread volcanism on the Jovian moon Io is powered by tidal heating, yet we lack a deep understanding of how this distinctive heating process affects the locations, timing, or intensities of Io's eruptions. We show that the quasiperiodic behavior of the volcano Loki Patera in 1987–2018 matches the timescales for the evolution of Io's eccentricity and semimajor axis ({\textasciitilde}480 and {\textasciitilde}460 days). If this orbital forcing is driving Loki Patera's variability, a low‐pass geophysical ﬁlter such as poroelastic ﬂow, or a resonant ampliﬁcation of Io's wobble, could account for the importance of these long‐period orbital variations despite their small amplitudes. The peak volcanic response is predicted to roughly coincide with Io's maximum eccentricity, consistent with the observations. High‐cadence observations over the next several years have the potential to conclusively discriminate between orbital versus geophysical control of Loki Patera's variability. Plain Language Summary Tidal heating is one of the central processes that generates heat in the interiors of planets and moons and is in part responsible for the existence of subsurface oceans and geological activity on moons in the outer solar system. Under this process, the amount of heating that occurs, and the stresses in the crust, vary periodically with the periodic tidal ﬂexing. As a result, we might expect that any geological activity powered by tidal heating, such as volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's tidally heated moon Io, would also vary periodically. Indeed, the water geysers on Saturn's moon Enceladus vary in strength over the course of Enceladus' orbit around Saturn due to tides opening and closing ﬁssures. Io takes only 1.77 days to orbit Jupiter, but its orbit is also slowly changing in time with a period of {\textasciitilde}480 days. We compare the variability of Io's volcanoes with the evolution of its orbit and ﬁnd that the quasiperiodic behavior of Loki Patera, the most powerful volcano on Io, follows a similar pattern as the orbital changes. We explore whether this volcano could be brightening and fading in response to changes in the heating and stresses produced by tides in its interior and what implications this has for the geophysical processes in Io's interior.},

We observed three such brightening events with adaptive optics imaging at the Keck and Gemini N telescopes over the course of 70 nights of observation in 2013–2016. The high cadence and multi-wavelength nature of the observations provides constraints on models for activity at Loki Patera. The Matson et al. (2006) model for Loki Patera as an overturning basaltic magma sea is adapted to ﬁt the observations of all three events. In particular, we adjust the details of the overturn progression, and modify the lava thermal properties to include dependencies on temperature and porosity, to improve the ﬁt to the data. The preferred models ﬁnd overturn front propagation velocities of 1.2–1.7 km/day, corresponding to resurfacing rates of 1500–2200 m2/s. The time intervals of 440–540 days between successive events are roughly consistent with the 540-day period calculated by Rathbun et al. (2002) for events prior to 2001. The best coverage was obtained for the 2016 brightening; model ﬁts to this event require a lava bulk thermal conductivity of 0.55–0.75 W/m/K, with the best ﬁt obtained for a value of ∼0.7 W/m/K and an average porosity that decreases during cooling. For all three events, the overturn front appears to propagate around the patera in the clockwise direction, opposite to what has been inferred for past brightening events. There is evidence that the overturn may be more complex than a single propagating wave, perhaps involving multiple simultaneous resurfacing waves as well as portions of the patera that are active even after the nominal bright phase has ended. The measured intensities are anomalously low when Loki Patera is viewed at high emission angles, suggestive of topographic shadowing due to a raised area or the edge of the depression in which the magma sea resides.},

	abstract = {We report results from a new technique for mapping Io’s SO2 vapor distribution. The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope observed Io during four Jupiter transit events to obtain medium resolution far-UV spectral images near the Lyα wavelength of 121.6 nm. Jupiter’s bright Lyα dayglow provides a bright, mostly uniform background light source for opacity measurements, much like during a stellar occultation or transiting exoplanet event. Peaks in the photoabsorption cross-sections for sulfur dioxide occur near 122 nm, with resulting absorptions raising the altitude where a tangential line-of-sight opacity of ∼1 occurs. This method of measuring column densities along lines of sight above the limb uses detailed image simulations and complements Lyα reﬂectance imaging and other methods for measuring Io’s SO2 gas on the disk. Our reported near-terminator limb observations with STIS conﬁrm the ﬁndings from previous Lyα disk reﬂectance imaging that Io’s polar SO2 density is an order of magnitude lower than found at the equator. We provide constraints for additional attenuation by atmospheric hydrogen atoms produced by charge exchange reactions between magnetospheric protons and Io’s atmosphere. Searches for plume-related features provided no deﬁnitive enhancements within the signal quality, ruling out unusually high levels of activity for Pele and Tvashtar.},

	abstract = {In February 2007, the New Horizons spacecraft ﬂew by the Jupiter system, obtaining images of Io, the most volcanically active body in the Solar System. The Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC), a four-color (visible to near infrared) camera, obtained 17 sets of images. The Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), a high-resolution panchromatic camera, obtained 190 images, including many of Io eclipsed by Jupiter. We present a complete view of the discrete point-like emission sources in all images obtained by these two instruments. We located 54 emission sources and determined their brightnesses. These observations, the ﬁrst that observed individual Ionian volcanoes on short timescales of seconds to minutes, demonstrate that the volcanoes have stable brightnesses on these timescales. The active volcanoes Tvashtar (63N, 124W) and E. Girru (22N, 245W) were observed by both LORRI and MVIC, both in the near-infrared (NIR) and methane (CH4) ﬁlters. Tvashtar was additionally observed in the red ﬁlter, which allowed us to calculate a color temperature of approximately 1200 K. We found that, with some exceptions, most of the volcanoes frequently active during the Galileo era continued to be active during the New Horizons ﬂyby. We found that none of the seven volcanoes observed by New Horizons multiple times over short timescales showed substantial changes on the order of seconds and only one, E. Girru exhibited substantial variation over minutes to days, increasing by 25\% in just over an hour and decreasing by a factor of 4 over 6 days. Observations of Tvashtar are consistent with a current eruption similar to previously observed eruptions and are more consistent with the thermal emission of a lava ﬂow than the ﬁre fountains inferred from the November 1999 observations. These data also present new puzzles regarding Ionian volcanism. Since there is no associated surface change or low albedo feature that could be identiﬁed nearby, the source of the emission from E. Girru is a mystery. Furthermore, the in-eclipse glows we observe over many paterae are likely to be gas emission from interaction with the magnetosphere, but the details of that process are not clear.},

	abstract = {Tidal heating is the major source of heat in the outer solar system. Because of its strong tidal interaction with Jupiter and the other Galilean satellites, Io is incredibly volcanically active. We use the directly measured volcanic activity level of Io’s volcanoes as a proxy for surface heat ﬂow and compare it to tidal heating model predictions. Volcanic activity is a better proxy for heat ﬂow than simply the locations of volcanic constructs. We determine the volcanic activity level using three data sets: the Galileo Photopolarimeter Radiometer (PPR), Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS), and New Horizons LEISA. We also present a systematic reanalysis of the Galileo NIMS observations to determine the 3.5 μm brightness of 51 active volcanoes. We ﬁnd that potential differences in volcanic style between high and low latitudes make high-latitude observations unreliable for distinguishing between tidal heating models. Observations of Io’s polar areas, such as those by Juno, are necessary to unambiguously understand Io’s heat ﬂow. However, all three of the data sets examined show a relative dearth of volcanic brightness near 180 W (anti-Jovian point) and the equator, and the only data set with good observations of the sub-Jovian point (LEISA) also shows a lack of volcanic brightness in that region. These observations are more consistent with the mantle-heating model than the asthenospheric-heating model. Furthermore, all three of the data sets are consistent with fourfold symmetry in longitude and peak heat ﬂow at mid-latitudes, which best matches with the combined heating case of Tackley et al.},

Geologic associations of hot spots, including patera type, lava ﬂow type, and proximity to mountainous regions, are made using the USGS-published global geologic map of Io (Williams, 2011).

Observations of Io at M (4.8 μm), 8.7 μm, N (10 μm), and Q (20 μm) with the Infrared Telescope Facility presented here were collected during nine apparitions between 1983 and 1993. These measurements provide full longitudinal coverage as well as an eclipse observation and the detection of two outbursts. Reflected sunlight, passive thermal emission, and radiation from thermal anomalies all contribute to the observed flux densities. We find that a new thermophysical model is required to match all the data. Two key elements of this model are (1) a “thermal reservoir” unit which lowers daytime temperatures, and (2) the “thermal pedestal effect” which shifts to shorter wave-lengths the spectral emission due to the reradiation of solar energy absorbed by the thermal anomalies. The thermal anomalies are modeled with a total of 10 source components at five locations. Io's heat flow is the sum of the power from these components.},

We obtained infrared photometry of four of these events at the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope at wavelengths of 5.0 or 3.4 μm, in order to investigate the nature and distribution of volcanism on Io by observing the occultation of the volcanic hot spots by the limb of Europa. Observations at 3.4 μm on 1991/01/08 detected a possible small hot spot in the northern hemisphere. Observations at 5.0 μm on 1991/02/27 detected and resolved the major hot spot Loki, which had a diameter of 170 km and had three times its Voyager 1 flux, and also detected the Voyager hot spot Pele at about half its Voyager 1 flux. A 5.0-μm occultation of Pele on 1991/03/06, when Loki was not occulted, indicated no significant flux change since the week before. Infrared images of Io obtained at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility between October 1990 and April 1991 show that the Europa occultations occurred during a period of unusually high activity at Loki. Loki showed very little thermal emission in observations between 1990/10/12 and 1990/11/27, but increased in flux by a factor of 10 in 32 days by 1991/12/29. Loki then remained bright in all observations until 1991/03/26, but had begun to fade on 1991/04/09. Such rapid variations in flux over such a large area are remarkable. Multiwavelength observations indicate that Loki increased in temperature during the brightening, and that materials hotter than 630 K were exposed at Loki. The possible "Pele-type" volcanoes Surt and Aten, unlike Pele, were not detected, with 3.8 μm flux upper limits of about 8 GW μm-1 str-1.},

The Jupiter occultation observations have spatial resolution limited to roughly the Jupiter atmospheric scale height (22 km) but as these events occur every Io orbit we have data on over 100. They include observations from the NASA-IRTF, WIRO, Lowell, and other telescopes on Mauna Kea. Part of this data set originally revealed the semi-periodic nature of the activity at Loki (Rathbun et al. 2002). A series of mutual satellite occultations occurs only every six years but the sharp limb of the other satellite allows for much higher spatial resolution. The original analysis was limited by
inaccuracies in the satellite ephemerides but improvements now allow us to more reliably assign brightnesses to individual hotspots. They also allow improved image reconstructions of individual spots from mutual events. We will report on our tests of that better ephemeris, the improved assignment of hotspot brightnesses, and the reconstructed mutual event images.},

We present the analysis of 35 observations of Amalthea and 19 observations of Thebe realized with the 1-m telescope at the Pic du Midi observatory during three nights in 2015, January and April. The images were reduced through an optimal process that includes image and spherical corrections using the Gaia-DR1 catalogue to provide the most accurate equatorial (RA, Dec.) positions. We compared the observed positions of both satellites with the theoretical positions from JPL JUP310 satellite ephemerides and from the IMCCE INPOP13c planetary ephemeris. The values of rms (O−C) in equatorial positions are ±112 mas for the Amalthea observations, or 330 km at Jupiter, and ±90 mas for the Thebe observations, or 270 km at Jupiter. Using the Gaia-DR1 catalogue allowed us to eliminate systematic errors due to the star references up to 120 mas, or 350 km at Jupiter, by comparison with the UCAC4 catalogue.},

	abstract = {Bayesian statistical analysis is steadily growing in popularity and use. Choosing priors is an integral part of Bayesian inference. While there exist extensive normative recommendations for prior setting, little is known about how priors are chosen in practice. We conducted a survey (N = 50) and interviews (N = 9) where we used interactive visualizations to elicit prior distributions from researchers experienced with Bayesian statistics and asked them for rationales for those priors. We found that participants' experience and philosophy influence how much and what information they are willing to incorporate into their priors, manifesting as different levels of informativeness and skepticism. We also identified three broad strategies participants use to set their priors: centrality matching, interval matching, and visual probability mass allocation. We discovered that participants' understanding of the notion of "weakly informative priors"---a commonly-recommended normative approach to prior setting---manifests very differently across participants. Our results have implications both for how to develop prior setting recommendations and how to design tools to elicit priors in Bayesian analysis.},

	abstract = {Gravitational microlensing surveys target very dense stellar ﬁelds in the local group. As a consequence, the microlensed source stars are often blended with nearby unresolved stars. The presence of ‘blending’ is a cause of major uncertainty when determining the lensing properties of events towards the Galactic centre. After demonstrating empirical cases of blending, we utilize Monte Carlo simulations to probe the effects of blending. We generate artiﬁcial microlensing events using a Hubble Space Telescope luminosity function convolved to typical ground-based seeing, adopting a range of values for the stellar density and seeing. Microlensing light curves are generated using typical sampling and errors from the second phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. We ﬁnd that a signiﬁcant fraction of bright events are blended, contrary to the oft-quoted assumption that bright events should be free from blending. We probe the effect that this erroneous assumption has on both the observed event time-scale distribution and the optical depth using realistic detection criteria relevant to the different surveys. Importantly, under this assumption the latter quantity appears to be reasonably unaffected across our adopted values for seeing and density. The time-scale distribution is, however, biased towards smaller values, even for the least-dense ﬁelds. The dominant source of blending is from lensing of faint source stars, rather than lensing of bright source stars blended with nearby fainter stars. We also explore other issues, such as the centroid motion of blended events and the phenomena of ‘negative’ blending. Furthermore, we brieﬂy note that blending can affect the determination of the centre of the red clump giant region from an observed luminosity function. This has implications for a variety of studies, for example mapping extinction towards the bulge and attempts to constrain the parameters of the Galactic bar through red clump giant number counts. We conclude that blending will be of crucial importance for future microlensing experiments if they wish to determine the optical depth to within 10 per cent or better.},

	abstract = {With planets orbiting stars, a planetary mass function should not be seen as a low-mass extension of the stellar mass function, but a proper formalism needs to take care of the fact that the statistical properties of planet populations are linked to the properties of their respective host stars. This can be accounted for by describing planet populations by means of a differential planetary mass-radius-orbit function, which together with the fraction of stars with given properties that are orbited by planets and the stellar mass function allows the derivation of all statistics for any considered sample. These fundamental functions provide a framework for comparing statistics that result from different observing techniques and campaigns which all have their very specific selection procedures and detection efficiencies. Moreover, recent results both from gravitational microlensing campaigns and
radial-velocity surveys of stars indicate that planets tend to cluster in systems rather than being the lonely child of their respective parent star. While planetary multiplicity in an observed system becomes obvious with the detection of several planets, its quantitative assessment however comes with the challenge to exclude the presence of further planets. Current exoplanet samples begin to give us first hints at the population statistics, whereas pictures of planet parameter space in its full complexity call for samples that are 2-4 orders of magnitude larger. In order to derive meaningful statistics, however, planet detection campaigns need to be designed in such a way that well-defined fully deterministic target selection, monitoring and detection criteria are applied. The probabilistic nature of gravitational microlensing makes this technique an illustrative example of all the encountered challenges and uncertainties.},

Our intensity distribution model for the eclipsed/occulted satellite is based on the criterion that it simulates a rotational light curve that matches the ground-based light curve. Dichotomy in the scattering characteristics of the leading and trailing sides explains the basic shape of the rotational light curves of Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. In the case of Io, the albedo map (courtesy United States Geological Survey) along with global values of scattering parameters works well. Mean values of residuals in (O − C) along and perpendicular to the track are found to be −3.3 and −3.4 mas, respectively, compared to ‘L2’ theory for the seven 2E1/2O1 events. The corresponding rms values are 8.7 and 7.8 mas, respectively. For the ﬁve 1E3/1O3 events, the along and perpendicular to the track mean residuals are 5.6 and 3.2 mas, respectively. The corresponding rms residuals are 6.8 and 10.5 mas, respectively. We compare the results using the chosen model (Model 1) with a uniform but limb-darkened disc (Model 2). The residuals with Model 2 of the 2E1/2O1 and 1E3/1O3 events indicate a bias along the satellite track. The extent and direction of bias are consistent with the shift of the light centre from the geometric centre. Results using Model 1, which intrinsically takes into account the intensity distribution, show no such bias.},

We obtained infrared photometry of four of these events at the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope at wavelengths of 5.0 or 3.4 μm, in order to investigate the nature and distribution of volcanism on Io by observing the occultation of the volcanic hot spots by the limb of Europa. Observations at 3.4 μm on 1991/01/08 detected a possible small hot spot in the northern hemisphere. Observations at 5.0 μm on 1991/02/27 detected and resolved the major hot spot Loki, which had a diameter of 170 km and had three times its Voyager 1 flux, and also detected the Voyager hot spot Pele at about half its Voyager 1 flux. A 5.0-μm occultation of Pele on 1991/03/06, when Loki was not occulted, indicated no significant flux change since the week before. Infrared images of Io obtained at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility between October 1990 and April 1991 show that the Europa occultations occurred during a period of unusually high activity at Loki. Loki showed very little thermal emission in observations between 1990/10/12 and 1990/11/27, but increased in flux by a factor of 10 in 32 days by 1991/12/29. Loki then remained bright in all observations until 1991/03/26, but had begun to fade on 1991/04/09. Such rapid variations in flux over such a large area are remarkable. Multiwavelength observations indicate that Loki increased in temperature during the brightening, and that materials hotter than 630 K were exposed at Loki. The possible "Pele-type" volcanoes Surt and Aten, unlike Pele, were not detected, with 3.8 μm flux upper limits of about 8 GW μm-1 str-1.},

Apparent distances from mutual phenomena, have much smaller errors, less than 10 mas. However, this method can only be applied during the equinox of the planets. We developed a method that can provide accurate astrometric data for natural satellites – the mutual approximations. The method can be applied when any two satellites pass close by each other in the apparent sky plane. The fundamental parameter is the central instant t0 of the passage when the distances reach a minimum. We applied the method for the Galilean moons. All observations were made with a 0.6 m telescope with a narrow-band ﬁlter centred at 889 nm with width of 15 nm which attenuated Jupiter’s scattered light. We obtained central instants for 14 mutual approximations observed in 2014–2015. We determined t0 with an average precision of 3.42 mas (10.43 km). For comparison, we also applied the method for 5 occultations in the 2009 mutual phenomena campaign and for 22 occultations in the 2014–2015 campaign. The comparisons of t0 determined by our method with the results from mutual phenomena show an agreement by less than 1σ error in t0, typically less than 10 mas. This new method is particularly suitable for observations by small telescopes.},

Time-resolved reﬂected light from an exoplanet encodes information about atmospheric and surface inhomogeneities. Previous research has shown that the light curve of an exoplanet can be inverted to obtain a low-resolution map of the planet, as well as constraints on its spin orientation. Estimating the uncertainty on 2D albedo maps has so far remained elusive. Here, we present exocartographer, a ﬂexible open-source Bayesian framework for solving the exocartography inverse problem. The map is parameterized with equal-area Hierarchical, Equal Area, and isoLatitude Pixelation (HEALPix) pixels. For a ﬁducial map resolution of 192 pixels, a four-parameter Gaussian process describing the spatial scale of albedo variations, and two unknown planetary spin parameters, exocartographer explores a 198-dimensional parameter space. To test the code, we produce a light curve for a cloudless Earth in a face-on orbit with a 90° obliquity. We produce synthetic white-light observations of the planet: ﬁve epochs of observations throughout the planet’s orbit, each consisting of 24 hourly observations with a photometric uncertainty of 1\% (120 data points). We retrieve an albedo map and—for the ﬁrst time—its uncertainties, along with spin constraints. The albedo map is recognizably of Earth, with a typical 90\% uncertainty of 0.14. The retrieved characteristic length scale is ∼9800 km. The obliquity is recovered to be {\textgreater}87°.9 at the 90\% credible level. Despite the uncertainty in the retrieved albedo map, we robustly identify a high-albedo region (the Sahara desert) and a large low-albedo region (the Paciﬁc Ocean).},

The result from stacking is not necessarily equivalent, even asymptotically, to fully Bayesian inference, but it serves many of the same goals. Under misspeciﬁed models, stacking can give better predictive performance than full Bayesian inference, hence the multimodality can be considered a blessing rather than a curse.},

mapping-quality data for dozens of exoplanets. The thermal phase mapping
problem has previously been solved analytically, with orthogonal maps
(spherical harmonics) yielding orthogonal light curves (sinusoids). The
eclipse mapping problem, let alone combined phase+eclipse mapping, does
not lend itself to such a neat solution. Previous efforts have adopted
either spherical harmonics or various ad hoc map parameterizations, none
of which produce orthogonal light curves. We use principal component
analysis to construct orthogonal “eigencurves,” which we
then use to fit published 8 μm observations of the hot Jupiter HD
189733b. This approach has a few advantages over previously used
techniques: (1) the light curves can be precomputed, accelerating the
fitting process, (2) the eigencurves are orthogonal to each other,
reducing parameter correlations, and (3) the eigencurves are
model-independent and are ranked in order of sensitivity. One notable
result of our analysis is that eclipse-only mapping of HD 189733b is far
more sensitive to the central concentration of dayside flux than to the
eastward offset of that hot spot. Mapping can, in principle, suffer from
degeneracies between spatial patterns and orbital parameters. Previous
mapping efforts using these data have either assumed a circular orbit
and precise inclination, or have been pessimistic about the prospects of
eclipse mapping in the face of uncertain orbital parameters. We show
that for HD 189733b the combined photometry and radial velocity are
sufficiently precise to retire this concern. Lastly, we present the
first map of brightness temperature, and we quantify the amplitude and
longitude offset of the dayside hot spot.},

Roman will even be sensitive to planetary mass objects that are not gravitationally bound to any host star. Such free-floating planetary mass objects (FFPs) will be detected as isolated microlensing events with timescales shorter than a few days. A measurement of the abundance and mass function of FFPs is a powerful diagnostic of the formation and evolution of planetary systems, as well as the physics of the formation of isolated objects via direct collapse. We show that Roman will be sensitive to FFP lenses that have masses from that of Mars (\$0.1 M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$) to gas giants (\$M{\textbackslash}gtrsim100M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$) as isolated lensing events with timescales from a few hours to several tens of days, respectively. We investigate the impact of the detection criteria on the survey, especially in the presence of finite-source effects for low-mass lenses. The number of detections will depend on the abundance of such FFPs as a function of mass, which is at present poorly constrained. Assuming that FFPs follow the fiducial mass function of cold, bound planets adapted from Cassan et al. (2012), we estimate that Roman will detect \${\textbackslash}sim250\$ FFPs with masses down to that of Mars (including \${\textbackslash}sim 60\$ with masses \${\textbackslash}le M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$).

	abstract = {The growing field of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods 
for probabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even
with large data sets. Gaussian processes (GPs) are a popular class of
models used for this purpose, but since the computational cost scales,
in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application
has been limited to small data sets. In this paper, we present a novel
method for GPs modeling in one dimension where the computational
requirements scale linearly with the size of the data set. We
demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical
time series data sets. These demonstrations are examples of
probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic
oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method
exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is
expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly
spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises
naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically driven damped

We have obtained synthetic photometry and produced colour-magnitude diagrams which show different trends
associated with the object classes: generally, BL Lacs tend to become bluer when brighter and FSRQs become redder when brighter, although several objects exhibit both trends, depending on brightness. We have also applied a pattern recognition algorithm to obtain the minimum number of physical components which can explain the variability of the optical spectrum. We have used NMF (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization) instead of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to avoid un-realistic negative components. For most targets we found that 2 or 3
meta-components are enough to explain the observed spectral variability.},

The constructed model is then rescaled with a factor to compensate for the contribution from the disks. We compare NMF with existing methods (classical reference differential imaging method, and the
Karhunen-Loève image projection algorithm) using synthetic
circumstellar disks and demonstrate the superiority of NMF: with no need of prior selection of references, NMF not only can detect fainter circumstellar disks but also better preserves their morphology and does not require forward modeling.

coronagraphic observations of HD 181327 with different methods and compare them, and NMF is able to extract some circumstellar materials inside the primary ring for the first time. In an appendix, we

With existing PSF construction methods, the circumstellar signals (e.g., planets, circumstellar disks) are unavoidably altered by overfitting and/or self-subtraction, making forward modeling a necessity to recover these signals. We present a forward modeling-free solution to these problems with data imputation using sequential nonnegative matrix factorization (DI-sNMF), which first converts this signal separation problem to a "missing data" problem in statistics by flagging the regions that host circumstellar signals as missing data, then attributes PSF signals to these regions. We
mathematically prove it to have negligible alteration to circumstellar signals when the imputation region is relatively small, which thus enables precise measurement of these circumstellar objects. We apply it to simulated point-source and circumstellar disk observations to demonstrate its proper recovery of them. We apply it to Gemini Planet Imager K1-band observations of the debris disk surrounding HR 4796A, finding a tentative trend that the dust is more forward scattering as the wavelength increases. We expect DI-sNMF to be applicable to other general scenarios where the separation of signals is needed.},

	abstract = {A new variant ‘PMF’ of factor analysis is described. It is assumed that X is a matrix of observed data and σ is the known matrix of standard deviations of elements of X. Both X and σ are of dimensions n × m. The method solves the bilinear matrix problem X = GF + E where G is the unknown left hand factor matrix (scores) of dimensions n × p, F is the unknown right hand factor matrix (loadings) of dimensions p × m, and E is the matrix of residuals. The problem is solved in the weighted least squares sense: G and F are determined so that the Frobenius norm of E divided (element-by-element) by σ is minimized. Furthermore, the solution is constrained so that all the elements of G and F are required to be non-negative. It is shown that the solutions by PMF are usually different from any solutions produced by the customary factor analysis (FA, i.e. principal component analysis (PCA) followed by rotations). Usually PMF produces a better fit to the data than FA. Also, the result of PF is guaranteed to be non-negative, while the result of FA often cannot be rotated so that all negative entries would be eliminated. Different possible application areas of the new method are briefly discussed. In environmental data, the error estimates of data can be widely varying and non-negativity is often an essential feature of the underlying models. Thus it is concluded that PMF is better suited than FA or PCA in many environmental applications. Examples of successful applications of PMF are shown in companion papers.},

The present-day lunar orbit is known to submeter accuracy through fitting lunar laser ranging data with an updated lunar gravity field from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission. The orbits of the inner planets are known to subkilometer accuracy through fitting radio tracking measurements of spacecraft in orbit about them. Very long baseline interferometry measurements of spacecraft at Mars allow the orientation of the ephemeris to be tied to the
International Celestial Reference Frame with an accuracy of 0''.0002. This orientation is the limiting error source for the orbits of the terrestrial planets, and corresponds to orbit uncertainties of a few hundred meters. The orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are determined to accuracies of tens of kilometers as a result of fitting spacecraft tracking data. The orbits of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are determined primarily from astrometric observations, for which measurement
uncertainties due to the Earth's atmosphere, combined with star catalog uncertainties, limit position accuracies to several thousand kilometers. DE430 and DE431 differ in their integrated time span and lunar dynamical modeling. The dynamical model for DE430 included a damping term between the Moon's liquid core and solid mantle that gives the best fit to lunar laser ranging data but that is not suitable for backward integration of more than a few centuries. The ephemeris DE431 is similar to DE430 but was fit without the core/mantle damping term, so the lunar orbit is less accurate than in DE430 for times near the current epoch, but is more suitable for times more than a few centuries in the past. DE431 is a longer integration (covering years -13,200 to +17,191) than DE430 (covering years 1550 to 2650).},

This observation enabled us to create a novel cross-check of single NS runs. The tests can detect when an NS run failed to sample new live points from the constrained prior and plateaus in the likelihood function, which break an assumption of NS and thus leads to unreliable results. We applied our cross-check to NS runs on toy functions with known analytic results in 2 - 50 dimensions, showing that our approach can detect problematic runs on a variety of likelihoods, settings and dimensions. As an example of a realistic application, we cross-checked NS runs performed in the context of cosmological model selection. Since the cross-check is simple, we recommend that it become a mandatory test for every applicable NS run.},

Methods: We apply a Maxwell viscoelastic rheology to compute the tidal response of the planets using the volume-weighted average of the viscosities and rigidities of the metal, rock,
high-pressure ice, and liquid water/ice I layers. Results: We show that TRAPPIST-1d and e can avoid entering a runaway greenhouse state. Planet e is the most likely to support a habitable environment, with Earth-like surface temperatures and possibly liquid water oceans. Planet d also avoids a runaway greenhouse, if its surface reflectance is at least as high as that of the Earth. Planets b and c, closer to the star, have heat fluxes high enough to trigger a runaway greenhouse and to support volcanism on the surfaces of their rock layers, rendering them too warm for life. Planets f, g, and h are too far from the star to experience significant tidal heating, and likely have solid ice surfaces with possible subsurface liquid water oceans.},

describe how sodium (Na I) and potassium (K I) gas could be a signature

Analyzing ∼a dozen close-in gas giants hosting robust alkaline
detections, we show that an Io-sized satellite can be stable against
orbital decay below a planetary tidal \{\{ {\textbackslash}mathcal Q \}\}p≲
\{10\}11. This tidal energy is also focused into the satellite
driving an ∼105±2 higher mass-loss rate than
Io’s supply to Jupiter’s Na exosphere based on simple
atmospheric loss estimates. The remarkable consequence is that several
exo-Io column densities are, on average, more than sufficient to provide
the ∼1010±1 Na cm‑2 required by
the equivalent width of exoplanet transmission spectra. Furthermore, the
benchmark observations of both Jupiter’s extended (∼1000 R
J) Na exosphere and Jupiter’s atmosphere in
transmission spectroscopy yield similar Na column densities that are
purely exogenic in nature. As a proof of concept, we fit the
“high-altitude” Na at WASP-49b with an ionization-limited
cloud similar to the observed Na profile about Io. Moving forward, we
strongly encourage time-dependent ingress and egress monitoring along

	abstract = {Geological activity is thought to be important for the origin of life and for maintaining planetary habitability. We show that transient sulfate aerosols could be a signature of exoplanet volcanism and therefore of a geologically active world. A detection of transient aerosols, if linked to volcanism, could thus aid in habitability evaluations of the exoplanet. On Earth, subduction-induced explosive eruptions inject SO2 directly into the stratosphere, leading to the formation of sulfate aerosols with lifetimes of months to years. We demonstrate that the rapid increase and gradual decrease in sulfate aerosol loading associated with these eruptions may be detectable in transit transmission spectra with future large-aperture telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), for a planetary system at a distance of 10 pc, assuming an Earth-like atmosphere, bulk composition, and size. Specifically, we find that a signal-to-noise ratio of 12.1 and 7.1 could be achieved with E-ELT (assuming photon-limited noise) for an Earth analogue orbiting a Sun-like star and M5V star, respectively, even without multiple transits binned together. We propose that the detection of this transient signal would strongly suggest an exoplanet volcanic eruption, if potential false positives such as dust storms or bolide impacts can be ruled out. Furthermore, because scenarios exist in which O2 can form abiotically in the absence of volcanic activity, a detection of transient aerosols that can be linked to volcanism, along with a detection of O2, would be a more robust biosignature than O2 alone.

We calculate the observation time needed to detect explosive volcanism on exoplanets in primary as well as secondary eclipse and discuss the likelihood of observing volcanism on transiting Earth-sized to super-Earth-sized exoplanets. We find that sulfur dioxide from large explosive eruptions does present a spectral signal that is remotely detectable especially for secondary eclipse measurements around the closest stars and ground-based telescopes, and report the frequency and magnitude of the expected signatures. The transit probability of a planet in the habitable zone decreases with distance from the host star, making small, nearby host stars the best targets.},

These are events during which a planet occults the disk of another planet in the same system, imparting a small photometric signal as its thermal or reﬂected light is blocked. We focus on the planets in TRAPPIST-1, whose orbital planes we show are aligned to {\textless}0. 3 at 90\% conﬁdence. We present a photodynamical model for predicting and computing PPOs in TRAPPIST-1 and other systems for various assumptions of the planets’ atmospheric states. When marginalizing over the uncertainties on all orbital parameters, we ﬁnd that the rate of PPOs in TRAPPIST-1 is about 1.4 per day. We investigate the prospects for detection of these events with the James Webb Space Telescope, ﬁnding that ∼10–20 occultations per year of b and c should be above the noise level at 12–15μm. Joint modeling of several of these PPOs could lead to a robust detection. Alternatively, observations with the proposed Origins Space Telescope should be able to detect individual PPOs at high signal-to-noise ratios. We show how PPOs can be used to break transit timing variation degeneracies, imposing strong constraints on the eccentricities and masses of the planets, as well as to constrain the longitudes of nodes and thus the complete three-dimensional structure of the system. We further show how modeling of these events can be used to reveal a planet’s day/night temperature contrast and construct crude surface maps.

	abstract = {Highly volcanic exoplanets, which can be variously characterized as 'lava worlds', 'magma ocean worlds', or 'super-Ios' are high priority targets for investigation. The term 'lava world' may refer to any planet with extensive surface lava lakes, while the term 'magma ocean world' refers to planets with global or hemispherical magma oceans at their surface. 'Highly volcanic planets', including super-Ios, may simply have large, or large numbers of, active explosive or extrusive volcanoes of any form. They are plausibly highly diverse, with magmatic processes across a wide range of compositions, temperatures, activity rates, volcanic eruption styles, and background gravitational force magnitudes. Worlds in all these classes are likely to be the most characterizable rocky exoplanets in the near future due to observational advantages that stem from their preferential occurrence in short orbital periods and their bright day-side flux in the infrared. Transit techniques should enable a level of characterization of these worlds analogous to hot Jupiters. Understanding processes on highly volcanic worlds is critical to interpret imminent observations. The physical states of these worlds are likely to inform not just geodynamic processes, but also planet formation, and phenomena crucial to habitability. Volcanic and magmatic activity uniquely allows chemical investigation of otherwise spectroscopically inaccessible interior compositions. These worlds will be vital to assess the degree to which planetary interior element abundances compare to their stellar hosts, and may also offer pathways to study both the very young Earth, and the very early form of many silicate planets where magma oceans and surface lava lakes are expected to be more prevalent. We suggest that highly volcanic worlds may become second only to habitable worlds in terms of both scientific and public long-term interest.},

	abstract = {The thermal phase curve of 55 Cancri e is the ﬁrst measurement of the temperature distribution of a tidally locked super-Earth, but raises a number of puzzling questions about the planet’s climate. The phase curve has a high amplitude and peak offset, suggesting that it has a signiﬁcant eastward hot-spot shift as well as a large day–night temperature contrast. We use a general circulation model to model potential climates, and investigate the relation between bulk atmospheric composition and the magnitude of these seemingly contradictory features. We conﬁrm theoretical models of tidally locked circulation are consistent with our numerical model of 55 Cnc e, and rule out certain atmospheric compositions based on their thermodynamic properties. Our best-ﬁtting atmosphere has a signiﬁcant hot-spot shift and day–night contrast, although these are not as large as the observed phase curve. We discuss possible physical processes that could explain the observations, and show that night-side cloud formation from species such as SiO from a day-side magma ocean could potentially increase the phase curve amplitude and explain the observations. We conclude that the observations could be explained by an optically thick atmosphere with a low mean molecular weight, a surface pressure of several bars, and a strong eastward circulation, with nightside cloud formation a possible explanation for the difference between our model and the observations.},

Using a spherical harmonic-based reflection model developed as an extension of the STARRY package, we are able to reconstruct the surface features of this rocky world. We recover a time-variable albedo map of the planet including persistent regions which we interpret as oceans and cloud banks indicative of continental features. We argue that this planet represents the most promising detection of a habitable world to date, although the potential intelligence of any life on it is yet to be determined.},

need accurate positions spread over extended periods. We present the
results of the 2014-2015 Brazilian campaign for 40 mutual events from 47
observed light curves by the Galilean satellites plus one eclipse of
Amalthea by Ganymede. We also reanalysed and updated results for 25
mutual events observed in the 2009 campaign.

All telescopes were equipped with narrow-band filters centred at 889 nm
with a width of 15 nm to eliminate the scattered light from Jupiter. The
albedos' ratio was determined using images before and after each event.
We simulated images of moons, umbra, and penumbra in the sky plane, and
integrated their fluxes to compute albedos, simulate light curves and
fit them to the observed ones using a chi-square fitting procedure. For
that, we used the complete version of the Oren-Nayer reflectance model.
The relative satellite positions mean uncertainty was 11.2 mas ( 35 km)
and 10.1 mas ( 31 km) for the 2014-2015 and 2009 campaigns
respectively. The simulated and observed ASCII light curve files are
freely available in electronic form at the Natural Satellites DataBase
(NSDB).

The 40/25 mutual events from our 2014-2015/2009 campaigns represent a
significant contribution of 17\%/15\% in comparison with the PHEMU
campaigns lead by the IMCCE. Besides that, our result for the eclipse of
Amalthea is only the 4th such measurement ever published
after the three ones observed by the 2014-2015 international PHEMU
campaign. Our results are suitable for new orbital/ephemeris

gave the correct values of the radii. The values found are: radius of

	abstract = {We present adaptive optics (AO) observations of Io taken with the W.M. Keck II telescope on 18 December 2001 (UT) before the satellite went into eclipse, and while it was in Jupiter's shadow. Making these kind of Io-in-eclipse observations, as well as the associated data reduction and analysis are challenging; hence one focus of the paper is to explain the methods and tools used for these data sets. For the sunlit images Io itself was used as the wavefront reference source, while nearby Ganymede was used as reference 'star' when Io was in eclipse. Observations were obtained in K'-, L'-, and M-bands. The sunlit images have been
deconvolved using MISTRAL. The Io-in-eclipse data were deconvolved with IDAC and MISTRAL. The former gives better results, both in absolute photometry and in matching the original images. We determined the flux densities of the hot spots from the original Io-in-eclipse data with StarFinder, as well as from the deconvolved images by integrating the intensity over the relevant areas. We determined the highly
anisoplanatic PSF via a FFT method from the original data, and used this in StarFinder and as a starting PSF for IDAC and MISTRAL. We derived temperatures and areal coverage of all 19 spots detected in both K'- and L'-band images of Io-in-eclipse. We also determined temperatures and areal coverage of the hot spots visible on the L'- and M-band images of sunlit Io. Most volcanoes contain a compact hot 'core' (≲10 km
2 at 600-800 K) within a larger area at lower temperatures (e.g., ∼10 2-10 4 km 2 at 300-500 K). The total heat flow contributed by these active volcanoes is 0.2 W m -2, ∼8\% of the average global heat flow measured at 5-20 μm by Veeder et al. [J. Geophys. Res. 99 (1994) 17095].},

Adding these data to those published by Rathbun and Spencer (2006) and the Gemini data of de Kleer and de Pater (2016a, 2017) results in a database of 3.5–3.8 μm emission from Loki Patera over almost 3 decades. Data presented here contain adaptive optics (AO) observations of Io’s sunlit hemisphere at wavelengths between 1.6 and 5 μm, AO observations of Io in eclipse at 2–5 μm, and non-AO observations of Io in eclipse at 1.6–12 μm. The non-AO data were taken in September of 1999, during the early phase of a brightening event that was documented by Howell et al. (2001). Dual-component Io Flow model (IFM) ﬁts to our 1999 observations show a mostly cool lava crust over almost the entire patera ﬂoor, with a relatively small hotter component making up less than 1\% of the total area, consistent with previous observations. The 30-year timeline of Loki Patera revealed that, after an apparent cessation of, or change in, brightening events in 2002, Loki Patera became active again in 2009. The more recent activity may have a slightly shorter periodicity than observed by Rathbun et al. (2002), and the direction of ﬂow propagation appears to have reversed. Since 2009 the ﬂow direction is in the clockwise direction, starting in the north or north-east corner and propagating along the patera towards the south-west. During the Galileo era the propagation was in the counter-clockwise direction, starting in the south-west and propagating towards the east. Both the 30-year timeline and the 1.6–12 μm spectrum that was obtained during the brightening event in 1999 agree well with Matson et al.’s (2006) overturning lava lake model, as modiﬁed by de Kleer and de Pater (2017).},

These observations, performed at thermal wavelengths when Io is in daylight, have been carefully processed to improve the sharpness of the initial, diffraction-limited, images. The myopic deconvolution process used ( idac) achieved an angular resolution estimated to be 0.15 arcsec, corresponding to a spatial resolution of ∼570 km on Io's disc at the time of the observations. The final
images show a number of bright features which have been compared with the Galileo/NIMS data, the only data set with a comparable resolution available for the anti-Jovian side of the satellite as well as its Jupiter-facing side. Our maps of the hot spot distribution are quite consistent with the Galileo data. The Jupiter-facing side is dominated by emission from Loki, which accounts for ∼25\% of the total hot spot emission from that side (and 45\% of that we were able to resolve and identify), although Loki was in a phase of decreasing activity (but not yet quiescent), as derived from ground-based monitoring observations. A few more hot sources are detected, including Pele-Pillan. The other hemisphere is characterized by a large number of moderately bright hot spots which are distributed around Bosphorus Regio. These preliminary observations fully demonstrate the capabilities of an AO system coupled with a thermal camera to monitor the volcanic activity of Io, in terms of morphology as well as thermal output. These monitoring capabilities will become especially important when the Galileo mission ends.},

particular emphasis on the observations carried out in late 1999 in
support of the Galileo flybys of Io. Use of a new myopic deconvolution
method, Myopic Iterative Step Preserving Algorithm (MISTRAL), especially
designed for planetary objects, significantly improves the quality and
the reliability of the reconstructed images. Using a simulation of
artificial images of Io, we estimate the extent to which this algorithm
is able to prevent noise amplification, to better restore sharp edges,
and to preserve the initial photometry. Once this algorithm has been
applied to our data and the solar-reflected background has been
subtracted, we have 89 images of Io available for search and temporal
survey of the hot spots over 4 years. In most cases, the data, acquired
during two consecutive nights, provide an almost global view of the
surface of Io. We identify 20 hot spots for which we determine the
coordinates and the brightness at 3.8 μm (as a function of time).
More than half of the hot spots were detected on all the images and were
considered as persistent. Particular emphasis has been put on the
brightest two hot spots, Loki and Pele, for which we obtain a
center-to-limb variation curve (a cosine curve for Loki and a curve
decreasing slightly faster than a cosine law for Pele with possible
physical interpretations). The temporal variations of their activity
have been derived over these 4 years and, for Loki, compared with the
results of other ground-based surveys. The variability of the other,
fainter, sources has also been derived but with less accuracy. We have
also identified a few new hot spots, some of which are transient, such
as a diffuse emission seen in September and November 1999 at the
location of the upcoming Tvashtar outburst. The data are based on
observations (58.F-1003, 63.S-0260, and 64.S-0661) collected at the

A new hot spot/volcano is identified close to the South Pole of Io, and others are seen in lower latitude regions, which were previously unmapped. Images of the same region taken 2 months apart also show variations of hot spot intensity, possibly due to new lava flows or to lava flow breakouts.},

Features similar to clusters of thunderstorms were found in the GRS. Nearby wave structures suggest that the GRS may be a shallow atmospheric feature. Changes in surface color and plume distribution indicate differences in resurfacing processes near hot spots on Io. Patchy emissions were seen while Io was in eclipse by Jupiter. The outer margins of prominent linear markings (triple bands) on Europa are diffuse, suggesting that material has been vented from fractures. Numerous small circular craters indicate
localized areas of relatively old surface. Pervasive brittle deformation of an ice layer appears to have formed grooves on Ganymede. Dark terrain unexpectedly shows distinctive albedo variations to the limit of resolution.},

During the Galileo era, two volcanoes were observed to be regularly active: Loki and either Kanehekili and/or Janus. At least 12 other active volcanoes were observed for shorter periods of time, including one distinguishable in images that include reﬂected sunlight.

The record of Large Igneous Provinces in Earth and other planetary objects suggest the existence of increasing, decreasing and cessation phases of major volcanic activity over geological time scales. We have extended the existing scale of measuring intensity of volcanic eruptions based on Earth based observations to accommodate intense and extreme volcanic activity. The mass of a rocky planetary object is found to be related to the magnitude of the internal heat, occurrences of Large Igneous Provinces and the duration of major volcanic activity from relevant data available for the inner solar system. The internal heat magnitude may also decide the intensity of volcanism in these planetary objects. The time evolution of volcanism in Earth and Mars has probably influenced the origin of life and biological evolution in these planets.},

If f is smooth, the proposed Block-Simultaneous Direction Method of Multipliers (bSDMM) can be interpreted as a proximal analog to inexact coordinate descent methods under constraints. Unlike alternative approaches for joint solvers of multiple-constraint problems, we do not require linear operators L of a constraint function gðL ÁÞ to be invertible or linked between each other. bSDMM is well-suited for a range of optimization problems, in particular for data analysis, where f is the likelihood function of a model and L could be a transformation matrix describing e.g. ﬁnite differences or basis transforms. We apply bSDMM to the Non-negative Matrix Factorization task of a hyperspectral unmixing problem and demonstrate convergence and effectiveness of multiple constraints on both matrix factors.

	abstract = {We present the source separation framework SCARLET for multi-band images, which is based on a generalization of the Non-negative Matrix Factorization to alternative and several simultaneous constraints. Our approach describes the observed scene as a mixture of components with compact spatial support and uniform spectra over their support. We present the algorithm to perform the matrix factorization and introduce constraints that are useful for optical images of stars and distinct stellar populations in galaxies, in particular symmetry and monotonicity with respect to the source peak position. We also derive the treatment of correlated noise and convolutions with band-dependent point spread functions, rendering our approach applicable to coadded images observed under variable seeing conditions. SCARLET thus yields a PSF-matched photometry measurement with an optimally chosen weight function given by the mean morphology in all available bands. We demonstrate the performance of SCARLET for deblending crowded extragalactic scenes and on an AGN jet -- host galaxy separation problem in deep 5-band imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Stategic Survey Program. Using simulations with prominent crowding we show that SCARLET yields superior results to the HSC-SDSS deblender for the recovery of total fluxes, colors, and morphologies. Due to its non-parametric nature, a conceptual limitation of SCARLET is its sensitivity to undetected sources or multiple stellar population within detected sources, but an iterative strategy that adds components at the location of significant residuals appears promising.

	abstract = {The characterization of geologic heterogeneity that affects flow and transport phenomena in the subsurface is essential for cost-effective and reliable decision-making in applications such as groundwater supply and contaminant cleanup. In the last decades, geostatistical inversion approaches have been widely used to tackle subsurface characterization problems and quantify their corresponding uncertainty. Some well-established geostatistical methods use models that assume gradually varying parameters. However, in many cases, the subsurface can often be better represented as consisting of a few relatively uniform geologic facies or zones with abrupt changes at their boundaries. We advance a Bayesian inversion approach with the gradient represented not through a Gaussian but a Laplace prior, also known as total variation prior, for the case that there are reasons to believe that discrete geologic structures with relatively homogeneous properties predominate in the subsurface but their number, locations, and shapes are unknown a priori. Structural parameters (or hyperparameters of the inversion scheme) are determined in a Bayesian framework by maximizing the marginal distribution of these parameters using an expectation-maximization approach; this allows proper weighting of prior versus data information and produces results with realistic uncertainty quantification. We present here three applications of the method: a time-varying extraction rate estimation at a well, a linear cross-well seismic tomography, and a nonlinear hydraulic tomography. These results are compared with those achieved in the classical geostatistical method and it is shown that the Bayesian inversion approach with total variation prior can be a useful tool to identify discrete geologic structures.},

	abstract = {Latent Gaussian models are a popular class of hierarchical models with applications in many fields. Performing Bayesian inference on such models can be challenging. Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms struggle with the geometry of the resulting posterior distribution and can be prohibitively slow. An alternative is to use an integrated nested Laplace approximation, whereby we marginalize out the latent Gaussian variables and estimate the hyperparameters with a deterministic scheme. This type of inference typically only works for low dimensional and unimodal hyperparameters. We bypass these limitations by coupling dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with an embedded Laplace approximation. Our implementation features a novel adjoint method to differentiate the marginal likelihood, which scales with high dimensional hyperparameters. We prototype the method in the probabilistic programming framework Stan and test the utility of the embedded Laplace approximation on several models: a classic Gaussian process, a general linear regression model with a sparsity inducing horseshoe prior, and a sparse kernel interaction model. The last two models are characterized by a high dimensional and a multimodal posterior distribution of the hyperparameters, and as such present novel applications of the embedded Laplace approximation. Depending on the cases, the benefits are either a dramatic speed-up, or an alleviation of the geometric pathologies that frustrate Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.},

Automatic differentiation is a powerful tool to automate the calculation of derivatives and is preferable to more traditional methods, especially when differentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions. The implementation of automatic differentiation however requires some care to insure efficiency. Modern differentiation packages deploy a broad range of computational techniques to improve applicability, run time, and memory management. Among these techniques are operation overloading, region based memory, and expression templates. There also exist several mathematical techniques which can yield high performance gains when applied to complex algorithms. For example, semi-analytical derivatives can reduce by orders of magnitude the runtime required to numerically solve and differentiate an algebraic equation. Open problems include the extension of current packages to provide more specialized routines, and efficient methods to perform higher-order differentiation.},

Perhaps a bit surprisingly, the understanding to its model identifiability---the major reason behind the interpretability in many applications such as topic mining and hyperspectral imaging---had been rather limited until recent years. Beginning from the 2010s, the identifiability research of NMF has progressed considerably: Many interesting and important results have been discovered by the signal processing (SP) and machine learning (ML) communities. NMF identifiability has a great impact on many aspects in practice, such as ill-posed formulation avoidance and performance-guaranteed algorithm design. On the other hand, there is no tutorial paper that introduces NMF from an identifiability viewpoint. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by offering a comprehensive and deep tutorial on model identifiability of NMF as well as the connections to algorithms and applications. This tutorial will help researchers and graduate students grasp the essence and insights of NMF, thereby avoiding typical `pitfalls' that are often times due to unidentifiable NMF formulations. This paper will also help practitioners pick/design suitable factorization tools for their own problems.},

	abstract = {The Proximal Gradient Method (PGM) is a robust and efficient way to minimize the sum of a smooth convex function \$f\$ and a non-differentiable convex function \$r\$. It determines the sizes of gradient steps according to the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of \$f\$. For many problems in data analysis, the Lipschitz constants are expensive or impossible to compute analytically because they depend on details of the experimental setup and the noise properties of the data. Adaptive optimization methods like AdaGrad choose step sizes according to on-the-fly estimates of the Hessian of \$f\$. As quasi-Newton methods, they generally outperform first-order gradient methods like PGM and adjust step sizes iteratively and with low computational cost. We propose an iterative proximal quasi-Newton algorithm, AdaProx, that utilizes the adaptive schemes of Adam and its variants (AMSGrad, AdamX, PAdam) and works for arbitrary proxable penalty functions \$r\$. In test cases for Constrained Matrix Factorization we demonstrate the advantages of AdaProx in fidelity and performance over PGM, especially when factorization components are poorly balanced.

	abstract = {Atmospheric retrieval of exoplanets from spectroscopic observations requires an extensive exploration of a highly degenerate and high-dimensional parameter space to accurately constrain atmospheric parameters. Retrieval methods commonly conduct Bayesian parameter estimation and statistical inference using sampling algorithms such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Nested Sampling. Recently several attempts have been made to use machine learning algorithms either to complement or replace fully Bayesian methods. While much progress has been made, these approaches are still at times unable to accurately reproduce results from contemporary Bayesian retrievals. The goal of our present work is to investigate the efficacy of machine learning for atmospheric retrieval. As a case study, we use the Random Forest supervised machine learning algorithm which has been applied previously with some success for atmospheric retrieval of the hot Jupiter WASP-12b using its near-infrared transmission spectrum. We reproduce previous results using the same approach and the same semi-analytic models, and subsequently extend this method to develop a new algorithm that results in a closer match to a fully Bayesian retrieval. We combine this new method with a fully numerical atmospheric model and demonstrate excellent agreement with a Bayesian retrieval of the transmission spectrum of another hot Jupiter, HD 209458b. Despite this success, and achieving high computational efficiency, we still find that the machine learning approach is computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional parameter spaces that are routinely explored with Bayesian retrievals with modest computational resources. We discuss the trade offs and potential avenues for the future.},

	abstract = {We develop a new retrieval scheme for obtaining two-dimensional surface maps of exoplanets from scattered light curves. In our scheme, the combination of the L1-norm and Total Squared Variation, which is one of the techniques used in sparse modeling, is adopted to find the optimal map. We apply the new method to simulated scattered light curves of the Earth, and find that the new method provides a better spatial resolution of the reconstructed map than those using Tikhonov regularization. We also apply the new method to observed scattered light curves of the Earth obtained during the two-year DSCOVR/EPIC observations presented by Fan et al. (2019). The method with Tikhonov regularization enables us to resolve North America, Africa, Eurasia, and Antarctica. In addition to that, the sparse modeling identifies South America and Australia, although it fails to find the Antarctica maybe due to low observational weights on the poles. Besides, the proposed method is capable of retrieving maps from noise injected light curves of a hypothetical Earth-like exoplanet at 10 pc with noise level expected from coronagraphic images from the planned telescope, the Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx). We find that the sparse modeling resolves Australia, Afro-Eurasia, North America, and South America using 2-year observation with a time interval of one month. Our study shows that the combination of sparse modeling and multi-epoch observation with 1 day per month can be used to identify main features of an Earth analog in future direct imaging missions such as HabEx and the Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR).},

Hundreds of planets have been found around Sun-like stars that are either Earth-sized but on shorter periods, or else on year-long orbits but somewhat larger. Under strong assumptions, exoplanet catalogs have been used to make an extrapolated estimate of the rate at which Sun-like stars host Earth analogs. These studies are complicated by the fact that every catalog is censored by non-trivial selection effects and detection efﬁciencies, and every property (period, radius, etc.) is measured noisily. Here we present a general hierarchical probabilistic framework for making justiﬁed inferences about the population of exoplanets, taking into account survey completeness and, for the ﬁrst time, observational uncertainties. We are able to make fewer assumptions about the distribution than previous studies; we only require that the occurrence rate density be a smooth function of period and radius (employing a Gaussian process). By applying our method to synthetic catalogs, we demonstrate that it produces more accurate estimates of the whole population than standard procedures based on weighting by inverse detection efﬁciency. We apply the method to an existing catalog of small planet candidates around G dwarf stars. We conﬁrm a previous result that the radius distribution changes slope near Earth’s radius. We ﬁnd that the rate density of Earth analogs is about 0.02 (per star per natural logarithmic bin in period and radius) with large uncertainty. This number is much smaller than previous estimates made with the same data but stronger assumptions.},

The observations were conducted with non-sidereal tracking on Jupiter outside of the ﬁeld of view to reduce the stray light subtraction uncertainty due to the close proximity of Jupiter. Their eclipsed luminosity was 10−6–10−7 of their uneclipsed brightness, which is low enough that this phenomenon has been undiscovered until now. In addition, Europa in eclipse was {\textless}1/10 of the others at 1.5 μm, a potential clue to the origin of the source of luminosity. Likewise, Ganymede observations were attempted at 3.6 μm by the Spitzer Space Telescope, but it was not detected, suggesting a signiﬁcant wavelength dependence. It is still unknown why they are luminous even when in the Jovian shadow, but forward-scattered sunlight by hazes in the Jovian upper atmosphere is proposed as the most plausible candidate. If this is the case, observations of these Galilean satellites while eclipsed by the Jovian shadow provide us with a new technique to investigate the Jovian atmospheric composition. Investigating the transmission spectrum of Jupiter by this method is important for investigating the atmosphere of extrasolar giant planets by transit spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {We present in this Keck AO paper the ﬁrst global high angular resolution observations of Io in three broadband near-infrared ﬁlters: Kc (2.3 µm), Lp (3.8 µm), and Ms (4.7 µm). The Keck AO observations are composed of 13 data sets taken during short time intervals spanning 10 nights in December, 2001. The MISTRAL deconvolution process, which is speciﬁcally aimed for planetary images, was applied to each image. The spatial resolution achieved with those ground-based observations is 150, 240, and 300 km in the Kc, Lp, and Ms band, respectively, making them similar in quality to most of the distant observations of the Galileo/NIMS instrument. Eleven images per ﬁlter were selected and stitched together after being deprojected to build a cylindrical map of the entire surface of the satellite. In Kc-band, surface albedo features, such as paterae (R {\textgreater} 60 km) are easily identiﬁable. The Babbar region is characterized by extremely low albedo at 2.2 µm, and shows an absorption band at 0.9 µm in Galileo/SSI data. These suggest that this region is covered by dark silicate deposits, possibly made of orthopyroxene. In the Lp–Ms (3–5 µm) bands, the thermal emission from active centers is easily identiﬁed. We detected 26 hot spots in both broadband ﬁlters over the entire surface of the minor planet; two have never been seen active before, nine more are seen in the Ms band. We focused our study on the hot spots detected in both broadband ﬁlters. Using the measurements of their brightness, we derived the temperature and area covered by 100 brightness measurements. Loki displayed a relatively quiescent activity. Dazhbog, a new eruption detected by Galileo/NIMS in August 2001, is a major feature in our survey. We also point out the fading of Tvashtar volcanic activity after more than two years of energetic activity, and the presence of a hot, but small, active center at the location of Surt, possibly a remnant of its exceptional eruption detected in February 2001. Two new active centers, labeled F and V on our data, are detected. Using the best temperature and the surface area derived from the L and M band intensities, we calculated the thermal output of each active center. The most energetic hot spots are Loki and Dazhbog, representing respectively 36 and 19\% of the total output calculated from a temperature ﬁt of all hot spots (20.6 × 1012 W). Based on the temperature derived from hot spots (∼400 K), our measurement can unambiguously identify the contribution to the heat ﬂux from the silicate portion of the surface. Because the entire surface was observed, no extrapolation was required to calculate that ﬂux. It is also important to note that we measured the brightness of the individual hot spots when they were located close to the Central Meridian. This minimizes the line-of-sight effect which does not follow strictly a classical cosine law. Finally, we argue that despite the widespread volcanic activity detected, Io was relatively quiescent in December 2001, with a minimum mean total output of 0.4–1.2 W m−2. This output is at least a factor of two lower than those inferred from observations made at longer wavelengths and at different epochs.},

Its atmosphere may be water-rich and have a large scale-height, though attempts to characterize it have yielded ambiguous results. Here we present a sensitive search for water and TiO in its atmosphere at high spectral resolution using the Gemini North telescope and the GRACES spectrograph. We combine observations with previous observations from Subaru and CFHT, improving the constraints on the presence of water vapor. We adopt parametric models with an updated planet radius based on recent measurements, and use a cross-correlation technique to maximize sensitivity. Our results are consistent with atmospheres that are cloudy or contain minimal amounts of water and TiO. Using these parametric models, we rule out a water-rich atmosphere (VMR {\textgreater}= 0.1\%) with a mean molecular weight of {\textless}= 15 g/mol at a 3 sigma confidence level, improving on the previous limit by a significant margin. For TiO, we rule out a mean molecular weight of {\textless}= 5 g/mol with a 3 sigma confidence level for a VMR greater than 10{\textasciicircum}-8; for a VMR of greater than 10{\textasciicircum}-7, the limit rises to a mean molecular weight of {\textless}= 10 g/mol. We can rule out low mean-molecular-weight chemical equilibrium models both including and excluding TiO/VO at very high confidence levels ({\textgreater} 10 sigma). Overall, our results are consistent with an atmosphere with a high mean molecular weight and/or clouds, or no atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are commonly used as a model of stochastic variability in astrophysical time series. In particular, GPs are frequently employed to account for correlated stellar variability in planetary transit light curves. The efficient application of GPs to light curves containing thousands to tens of thousands of datapoints has been made possible by recent advances in GP methods, including the celerite method. Here we present an extension of the celerite method to two input dimensions, where, typically, the second dimension is small. This method scales linearly with the total number of datapoints when the noise in each large dimension is proportional to the same celerite kernel and only the amplitude of the correlated noise varies in the second dimension. We demonstrate the application of this method to the problem of measuring precise transit parameters from multiwavelength light curves and show that it has the potential to improve transit parameters measurements by orders of magnitude. Applications of this method include transit spectroscopy and exomoon detection, as well a broader set of astronomical problems.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09599},
	abstract = {Recent observations of the potentially habitable planets TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g suggest that they possess large water mass fractions of possibly several tens of wt\% of water, even though the host star's activity should drive rapid atmospheric escape. These processes can photolyze water, generating free oxygen and possibly desiccating the planet. After the planets formed, their mantles were likely completely molten with volatiles dissolving and exsolving from the melt. In order to understand these planets and prepare for future observations, the magma ocean phase of these worlds must be understood. To simulate these planets, we have combined existing models of stellar evolution, atmospheric escape, tidal heating, radiogenic heating, magma ocean cooling, planetary radiation, and water-oxygen-iron geochemistry. We present magmoc, a versatile magma ocean evolution model, validated against the rocky Super-Earth GJ 1132b and early Earth. We simulate the coupled magma ocean-atmospheric evolution of TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g for a range of tidal and radiogenic heating rates, as well as initial water contents between 1 and 100 Earth-oceans. We find that TRAPPIST-1 f and g most likely followed the extremely wet scenario with a prolonged magma ocean phase of at least 250 Myr. Planet e probably followed the dry or intermediate track, and may or may not have possessed little water vapour or oxygen in the atmosphere at the time of mantle solidification. For all planets that we investigated, we find that only 3-5\% of the initial water will be locked in the mantle after the magma ocean solidified.},

	abstract = {We present 1-mm observations constructed from ALMA [Atacama Large (sub)Millimeter Array] data of SO\$\_2\$, SO and KCl when Io went from sunlight into eclipse (20 March 2018), and vice versa (2 and 11 September 2018). There is clear evidence of volcanic plumes on 20 March and 2 September. The plumes distort the line profiles, causing high-velocity (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$500 m/s) wings, and red/blue-shifted shoulders in the line profiles. During eclipse ingress, the SO\$\_2\$ flux density dropped exponentially, and the atmosphere reformed in a linear fashion when re-emerging in sunlight, with a "post-eclipse brightening" after \${\textbackslash}sim\$10 minutes. While both the in-eclipse decrease and in-sunlight increase in SO was more gradual than for SO\$\_2\$, the fact that SO decreased at all is evidence that self-reactions at the surface are important and fast, and that in-sunlight photolysis of SO\$\_2\$ is the dominant source of SO. Disk-integrated SO\$\_2\$ in-sunlight flux densities are \${\textbackslash}sim\$2--3 times higher than in-eclipse, indicative of a roughly 30--50{\textbackslash}\% contribution from volcanic sources to the atmosphere. Typical column densities and temperatures are \$N {\textbackslash}approx (1.5 {\textbackslash}pm 0.3) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{16\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ and \$T {\textbackslash}approx 220-320\$ K both in-sunlight and in-eclipse, while the fractional coverage of the gas is 2--3 times lower in-eclipse than in-sunlight. The low level SO\$\_2\$ emissions present during eclipse may be sourced by stealth volcanism or be evidence of a layer of non-condensible gases preventing complete collapse of the SO\$\_2\$ atmosphere. The melt in magma chambers at different volcanoes must differ in composition to explain the absence of SO and SO\$\_2\$, but simultaneous presence of KCl over Ulgen Patera.},

	abstract = {In this paper we propose an analytic function for the spherical albedo values of airless and near-airless magma ocean planets (AMOPs). We generated 2-D fractal surfaces with varying compositions onto which we individually threw 10,000 light rays. Using an approximate form of the Fresnel equations we measured how much of the incident light was reflected. Having repeated this algorithm on varying surface roughnesses we find the spherical albedo as a function of the Hurst exponent, the geochemical composition of the magma, and the wavelength. As a proof of concept, we used our model on Kepler-10b to demonstrate the applicability of our approach. We present the spherical albedo values produced from different lava compositions and multiple tests that can be applied to observational data in order to determine their characteristics. Currently, there is a strong degeneracy in the surface composition of AMOPs due to the large uncertainties in their measured spherical albedos. In spite of this, when applied to Kepler-10b we show that its high albedo could be caused by a moderately wavy ocean that is rich in oxidised metallic species such as FeO, \${\textbackslash}rm Fe\_\{2\}O\_\{3\}\$, \${\textbackslash}rm Fe\_\{3\}O\_\{4\}\$. This would imply that Kepler-10b is a coreless or near-coreless body.},

	abstract = {The analysis of optical images of galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing systems can provide important information about the distribution of dark matter at small scales. However, the modeling and statistical analysis of these images is extraordinarily complex, bringing together source image and main lens reconstruction, hyper-parameter optimization, and the marginalization over small-scale structure realizations. We present here a new analysis pipeline that tackles these diverse challenges by bringing together many recent machine learning developments in one coherent approach, including variational inference, Gaussian processes, differentiable probabilistic programming, and neural likelihood-to-evidence ratio estimation. Our pipeline enables: (a) fast reconstruction of the source image and lens mass distribution, (b) variational estimation of uncertainties, (c) efficient optimization of source regularization and other hyperparameters, and (d) marginalization over stochastic model components like the distribution of substructure. We present here preliminary results that demonstrate the validity of our approach.},

There has been much recent work on normalizing flows, ranging from improving their expressive power to expanding their application. We believe the field has now matured and is in need of a unified perspective. In this review, we attempt to provide such a perspective by describing flows through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. We place special emphasis on the fundamental principles of flow design, and discuss foundational topics such as expressive power and computational trade-offs. We also broaden the conceptual framing of flows by relating them to more general probability transformations. Lastly, we summarize the use of flows for tasks such as generative modeling, approximate inference, and supervised learning.},

First, we introduce piecewise-polynomial coupling transforms that greatly increase the modeling power of individual coupling layers. Second, we propose to preprocess the inputs of neural networks using one-blob encoding, which stimulates localization of computation and improves inference. Third, we derive a gradient-descent-based optimization for the KL and the \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$ divergence for the specific application of Monte Carlo integration with unnormalized stochastic estimates of the target distribution. Our approach enables fast and accurate inference and efficient sample generation independently of the dimensionality of the integration domain. We show its benefits on generating natural images and in two applications to light-transport simulation: first, we demonstrate learning of joint path-sampling densities in the primary sample space and importance sampling of multi-dimensional path prefixes thereof. Second, we use our technique to extract conditional directional densities driven by the product of incident illumination and the BSDF in the rendering equation, and we leverage the densities for path guiding. In all applications, our approach yields on-par or higher performance than competing techniques at equal sample count.},

Such light curves will enable us to observe high-order microlensing effects which have been previously difficult to detect. In this paper, we investigate {\textbackslash}textit\{Roman\}'s potential to detect and characterize short-period planets and brown dwarfs (BDs) in source systems using the orbital motion of source stars, the so-called xallarap effect. We analytically estimate the measurement uncertainties of xallarap parameters using the Fisher matrix analysis. We show that the {\textbackslash}textit\{Roman\} Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) can detect warm Jupiters with masses down to 0.5 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jup\}\$ and orbital period of 30 days via the xallarap effect. Assuming a planetary frequency function from {\textbackslash}citet\{Cumming+2008\}, we find {\textbackslash}textit\{Roman\} will detect \${\textbackslash}sim10\$ hot and warm Jupiters and \${\textbackslash}sim30\$ close-in BDs around microlensed source stars during the microlensing survey. These detections are likely to be accompanied by the measurements of the companion's masses and orbital elements, which will aid in the study of the physical properties for close-in planet and BD populations in the Galactic bulge.},

Recently, as an alternative to hand-crafted bijections, Huang et al. (2018) proposed neural autoregressive flow (NAF) which is a universal approximator for density functions. Their flow is a neural network (NN) whose parameters are predicted by another NN. The latter grows quadratically with the size of the former and thus an efficient technique for parametrization is needed. We propose block neural autoregressive flow (B-NAF), a much more compact universal approximator of density functions, where we model a bijection directly using a single feed-forward network. Invertibility is ensured by carefully designing each affine transformation with block matrices that make the flow autoregressive and (strictly) monotone. We compare B-NAF to NAF and other established flows on density estimation and approximate inference for latent variable models. Our proposed flow is competitive across datasets while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters.},

Here we propose an alternative approach, using parallel runs of MCMC, variational, or mode-based inference to hit as many modes or separated regions as possible, and then combining these using importance sampling based Bayesian stacking, a scalable method for constructing a weighted average of distributions so as to maximize cross-validated prediction utility. The result from stacking is not necessarily equivalent, even asymptotically, to fully Bayesian inference, but it serves many of the same goals. Under misspeciﬁed models, stacking can give better predictive performance than full Bayesian inference, hence the multimodality can be considered a blessing rather than a curse.},

When the normalizing constant varies by orders of magnitude, methods based on importance sampling can require many rounds of tuning. We present an improved approach using adaptive path sampling, iteratively reducing gaps between the base and target. Using this adaptive strategy, we develop two metastable sampling schemes. They are automated in Stan and require little tuning. For a multimodal posterior density, we equip simulated tempering with a continuous temperature. For a funnel-shaped entropic barrier, we adaptively increase mass in bottleneck regions to form an implicit divide-and-conquer. Both approaches empirically perform better than existing methods for sampling from metastable distributions, including higher accuracy and computation efficiency.},

	abstract = {We propose a new Monte Carlo method for sampling from multimodal distributions. The idea of this technique is based on splitting the task into two: finding the modes of a target distribution \${\textbackslash}pi\$ and sampling, given the knowledge of the locations of the modes. The sampling algorithm relies on steps of two types: local ones, preserving the mode; and jumps to regions associated with different modes. Besides, the method learns the optimal parameters of the algorithm while it runs, without requiring user intervention. Our technique should be considered as a flexible framework, in which the design of moves can follow various strategies known from the broad MCMC literature. In order to design an adaptive scheme that facilitates both local and jump moves, we introduce an auxiliary variable representing each mode and we define a new target distribution \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}pi\}\$ on an augmented state space \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{X\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}times{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{X\}\$ is the original state space of \${\textbackslash}pi\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\$ is the set of the modes. As the algorithm runs and updates its parameters, the target distribution \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}pi\}\$ also keeps being modified. This motivates a new class of algorithms, Auxiliary Variable Adaptive MCMC. We prove general ergodic results for the whole class before specialising to the case of our algorithm.},

One of the major problems with MCMC is the question of how to design chains that mix fast over the whole state space; in particular, how to select the parameters of an MCMC algorithm. Here we take a diﬀerent approach and, similarly to parallel MCMC methods, instead of trying to ﬁnd a single chain that samples from the whole distribution, we combine samples from several chains run in parallel, each exploring only parts of the state space (e.g., a few modes only). The chains are prioritized based on the kernel Stein discrepancy, which provides a good measure of performance locally. The samples from the independent chains are combined using a novel technique for estimating the probability of diﬀerent regions of the sample space. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm may provide signiﬁcant speedups in diﬀerent sampling problems. Most importantly, when combined with the state-ofthe-art NUTS algorithm as the base MCMC sampler, our method remained competitive with NUTS on sampling from unimodal distributions, while signiﬁcantly outperformed state-of-the-art competitors on synthetic multimodal problems as well as on a challenging sensor localization task.},

	abstract = {Galactic model plays an important role in the microlensing field, not only for analyses of individual events but also for statistics of the ensemble of events. However, the Galactic models used in the field varies, and some are unrealistically simplified. Here we tested three Galactic disc dynamic models, the first is a simple standard model that was widely used in this field, whereas the other two are more realistic taking into account the radial dependence of the velocity dispersion, and in the last model, the asymmetric drift. We found that for a typical lens mass \$M\_L=0.5M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, the more accurate dynamical models predict \${\textbackslash}sim41{\textbackslash}\%\$ or \${\textbackslash}sim27{\textbackslash}\%\$ less long-timescale events (\$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm E\}{\textgreater}300\$ days) and \${\textbackslash}sim 1{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \${\textbackslash}sim 12{\textbackslash}\%\$ more short-timescale events (\$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm E\}{\textless}3\$ days) than the standard model. Moreover, large Einstein radius (\${\textbackslash}theta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm E\}{\textgreater}1\$ mas) and large microlensing parallax (\${\textbackslash}pi\_\{{\textbackslash}rm E\}{\textgreater}0.3\$) events are expected to be more common. The more advanced models also have an impact on the total microlensing event rate. This result will also to some degree affect the Bayesian analysis of individual events, so we recommend that modelers should be more careful when choosing the Galactic model. Additionally, we find the asymptotic power-law behaviors in both \${\textbackslash}theta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm E\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}pi\_\{{\textbackslash}rm E\}\$ distributions, and we provide a simple model to understand them.},

Second, we identify a discriminant that enables a rational choice between Laguerre's Method and Newton's Method (or a new intermediate method) on a case-by-case basis. We briefly review the history of root solving and demonstrate that "Newton's Method" was discovered neither by Newton (1671) nor by Raphson (1690), but only by Simpson (1740). Some of the arguments leading to this conclusion were first given by the British historian of science Nick Kollerstrom in 1992, but these do not appear to have penetrated the astronomical community. Finally, we argue that Numerical Recipes should voluntarily surrender its copyright protection for non-profit applications, despite the fact that, in this particular case, such protection was the major stimulant for developing our improved algorithm.},

	abstract = {Gravitational microlensing offers a powerful method with which to probe a variety of binarylens systems, as the binarity of the lens introduces deviations from the typical (single-lens) Paczyn´ski behaviour in the event light curves. Generally, a static binary lens is considered to ﬁt the observed light curve and, when the orbital motion is taken into account, an oversimpliﬁed model is usually employed. In this paper, we treat the binary-lens motion in a realistic way and focus on simulated events that are ﬁtted well by a Paczyn´ski curve. We show that an accurate timing analysis of the residuals (calculated with respect to the best-ﬁtting Paczyn´ski model) is usually sufﬁcient to infer the orbital period of the binary lens. It goes without saying that the independently estimated period may be used to further constrain the orbital parameters obtained by the best-ﬁtting procedure, which often gives degenerate solutions. We also present a preliminary analysis of the event OGLE-2011-BLG-1127 / MOA-2011-BLG-322, which has been recognized to be the result of a binary lens. The period analysis results in a periodicity of 12 d, which conﬁrms the oscillation of the observed data around the best-ﬁtting model. The estimated periodicity is probably associated with an intrinsic variability of the source star, and therefore there is an opportunity to use this technique to investigate either the intrinsic variability of the source or the effects induced by the binary-lens orbital motion.},

Indeed, it is adopted to study the distribution of the stellar component in the Milky Way, to study dark matter and dark energy on very large scales and even to discover exoplanets. Moreover, thanks to technological developments, it will allow the measure of the physical parameters (mass, angular momentum and electric charge) of supermassive black holes in the center of ours and nearby galaxies.},

	abstract = {In gravitational microlensing, binary systems may act as lenses or sources. Identifying lens binarity is generally easy, in particular in events characterized by caustic crossing since the resulting light curve exhibits strong deviations from a smooth single-lensing light curve. In contrast, light curves with minor deviations from a Paczyński behavior do not allow one to identify the source binarity. A consequence of gravitational microlensing is the shift of the position of the multiple image centroid with respect to the source star location — the so-called astrometric microlensing signal. When the astrometric signal is considered, the presence of a binary source manifests with a path that largely differs from that expected for single source events. Here, we investigate the astrometric signatures of binary sources taking into account their orbital motion and the parallax effect due to the Earth’s motion, which turn out not to be negligible in most cases. We also show that considering the abovementioned effects is important in the analysis of astrometric data in order to correctly estimate the lens-event parameters.},

	abstract = {The 2015 New Horizons flyby has produced the first high-resolution maps of morphology and topography of Pluto and Charon, the most distant objects so mapped. Global integrated mosaics of Pluto were produced using both LORRI framing camera and MVIC line scan camera data, showing the best resolution data obtained for all areas of the illuminated surface, ∼78\% of the body. A unique feature of the Pluto imaging data set is the observation of terrains illuminated only by light scattered from atmospheric haze, allowing us to map terrains in the southern hemisphere that would otherwise have been in darkness. MVIC 4-color data were combined with the panchromatic map to produce full color global maps. Digital elevation models (DEMs) over ∼42\% of Pluto were produced using combinations of MVIC hemispheric scans and LORRI mosaics, from which slopes at scales of ∼1 km can be determined. Pluto can be divided into regions each with distinct topographic signatures, corresponding with major physiographic terrain types. Large areas of Pluto are comprised of low-relief moderately cratered plains units. Deeply pitted and glaciated plains east of Sputnik Planitia are elevated ∼0.7 km. The most dominant topographic feature on Pluto is the 1200-by-2000-km wide depression enclosing the bright Sputnik Planitia ice sheet, the surface of which is 2.5-to-3.5 km deep (relative to the rim) and ∼2 km deep relative to the mean radius. The partial ring of steep-sided massifs, several of which are more than 5 km high, along the western margins of Sputnik Planitia produce some of the locally highest and steepest relief on Pluto, with slopes of 40–50°. The second major topographic feature is a complex, eroded, ridge-trough system ∼300–400 km wide and at least 3200 km long extending north-to-south along the 155° meridian. This enormous structure has several kilometers of relief. It may predate the large impact event forming the basin, though some post-Sputnik Planitia deformation is evident. The large depressed, partially walled plain, Hyecho Palus, lies due southwest of Sputnik Planitia. Near the center of Hyecho Palus lie the circular constructional edifices Wright and Piccard Montes. Wright Mons rises 4.5 km above these plains, with a central depression ∼4.5 km deep, whereas Piccard Mons, best observed in haze-light, rises ∼5.5 km above the plains but has a bowl-shaped central depression ∼5.5 km below the plains for a total relief of up to 11 km, the greatest observed on Pluto. Both of these features are interpreted as constructional (volcanic?) in nature. Additional prominent topographic features include a 2–3 km high and ∼600 km wide dome centered on the illuminated IAU pole and the amoeboidal plateaus of “bladed” terrains in the equatorial region, which rise 2–5 km above local terrains and are the highest standing geologic units on the encounter hemisphere. The mean elevations in the integrated DEM for the two radio occultation areas are consistent with the 5–6 km difference in elevation as determined independently by the radio experiment, and a limb profile near the egress point confirms the presence of elevated bladed terrains in that area. Local relief of 3–5 km at massifs, troughs and pits supports conclusions that the icy shell of Pluto is relatively rigid. Numerous examples of topographic control of ice or frost deposition occur across Pluto, including the distinct coloration of the polar dome, the elevated terrains of eastern Tombaugh Regio, and along the ridge-trough system, where ridge tops and fossae rims are covered in different ices than at lower elevations. The topographic hypsogram of Pluto's encounter hemisphere is strongly bimodal due to the large Sputnik Planitia depression. Otherwise the topographic signature of Pluto is controlled by deviations from the otherwise dominant low plains, including elevated bladed terrain plateaus and the depressed volcanic province including Wright and Piccard Montes.},

	abstract = {The 2015 New Horizons flyby through the Pluto system produced the first high-resolution topographic maps of Pluto and Charon, the most distant objects so mapped. Global integrated mosaics of the illuminated surface of Pluto's large icy moon Charon have been produced using both framing camera and line scan camera data (including four-color images at up to 1.47 km pixel scales), showing the best resolution data at all areas of the surface. Digital elevation models (DEMs) with vertical precisions of up to ∼0.1 km were constructed for ∼40\% of Charon using stereo imagery. Local radii estimates for the surface were also determined from the cartographic control network solution for the LORRI framing camera data, which validate the stereo solutions. Charon is moderately cratered, the largest of which is ∼250-km across and ∼6 km deep. Charon has a topographic range over the observed hemisphere from lowest to highest of ∼19 km, the largest topographic amplitude of any mid-sized icy body (including Ceres) other than Iapetus. Unlike Saturn's icy moons whose topographic signature is dominated by global relaxation of topography and subsequent impact cratering, large-scale tectonics and regional resurfacing dominate Charon's topography. Most of Charon's encounter hemisphere north of the equator (Oz Terra) is broken into large polygonal blocks by a network of wide troughs with typically 3–6 km relief; the deepest of these occur near the illuminated pole and are up to 13 km deep with respect to the global mean radius, the deepest known surfaces on Charon. The edge of this terrain is defined by large tilted blocks sloping ∼5° or so, the crests of which rise to 5 or 6 km above Charon mean, the highest known points on Charon. The southern resurfaced plains, Vulcan Planitia, consist of rolling plains, locally fractured and pitted, that are depressed ∼1 km below the mean elevation of the disrupted northern terrains of Oz Terra that comprise much of the northern hemisphere (but ∼2–2.5 km below the surfaces of the blocks themselves). These plains roll downward gently to the south with a topographic range of ∼5 km. The outer margins of Vulcan Planitia along the boundary with Oz Terra form a 2-3-km-deep trough, suggesting viscous flow along the outer margins. Isolated massifs 2–4 km high, also flanked by annular moats, lie within the planitia itself. The plains may be formed from volcanic resurfacing of cryogenic fluids, but the tilted blocks along the outer margins and the isolated and tilted massifs within Vulcan Planitia also suggest that much of Charon has been broken into large blocks, some of which have been rotated and some of which have foundered into Charon's upper “mantle”, now exposed as Vulcan Planitia, a history that may be most similar to the disrupted terrains of Ariel.},

	abstract = {Since upcoming telescopes will observe thousands of strong lensing systems, creating fully-automated analysis pipelines for these images becomes increasingly important. In this work, we make a step towards that direction by developing the first end-to-end differentiable strong lensing pipeline. Our approach leverages and combines three important computer science developments: (a) convolutional neural networks, (b) efficient gradient-based sampling techniques, and (c) deep probabilistic programming languages. The latter automatize parameter inference and enable the combination of generative deep neural networks and physics components in a single model. In the current work, we demonstrate that it is possible to combine a convolutional neural network trained on galaxy images as a source model with a fully-differentiable and exact implementation of gravitational lensing physics in a single probabilistic model. This does away with hyperparameter tuning for the source model, enables the simultaneous optimization of nearly one hundred source and lens parameters with gradient-based methods, and allows the use of efficient gradient-based posterior sampling techniques. These features make this automated inference pipeline potentially suitable for processing a large amount of data. By analyzing mock lensing systems with different signal-to-noise ratios, we show that lensing parameters are reconstructed with percent-level accuracy. More generally, we consider this work as one of the first steps in establishing differentiable probabilistic programming techniques in the particle astrophysics community, which have the potential to significantly accelerate and improve many complex data analysis tasks.},

	abstract = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic regression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the benefit of both of these theoretical advances.},

	abstract = {Using a 3D general circulation model (GCM), we investigate the sensitivity of the climate of tidally locked Earthlike exoplanets, Trappist-1e and Proxima Centauri b, to the choice of a convection parameterization. Compared to a mass-flux convection parameterization, a simplified convection adjustment parameterization leads to a {\textgreater}60\% decrease of the cloud albedo, increasing the mean dayside temperature by . The representation of convection also affects the atmospheric conditions of the night side, via a change in planetary-scale wave patterns. As a result, using the convection adjustment scheme makes the nightside cold traps warmer by 17–36 K for the planets in our simulations. The day–night thermal contrast is sensitive to the representation of convection in 3D GCM simulations, so caution should be taken when interpreting emission phase curves. The choice of convection treatment, however, does not alter the simulated climate enough to result in a departure from habitable conditions, at least for the atmospheric composition and planetary parameters used in our study. The near-surface conditions both in the Trappist-1e and Proxima b cases remain temperate, allowing for an active water cycle. We further advance our analysis using high-resolution model experiments, in which atmospheric convection is simulated explicitly. Our results suggest that in a hypothetical global convection-permitting simulation, the surface temperature contrast would be higher than in the coarse-resolution simulations with parameterized convection. In other words, models with parameterized convection may overestimate the inter-hemispheric heat redistribution efficiency.},

Image cubes from December 2014 in eight spectral channels, with spectral resolutions of R ∼2000−12,000 and spatial resolutions of 2–4° latitude, are inverted to generate 3D maps of tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures, 2D maps of upper tropospheric aerosols, phosphine and ammonia, and 2D maps of stratospheric ethane and acetylene. The results are compared to a re-analysis of Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) observations acquired during Cassini’s closest approach to Jupiter in December 2000, demonstrating that this new archive of ground-based mapping spectroscopy can match and surpass the quality of previous investigations, and will permit future studies of Jupiter’s evolving atmosphere. The visibility of cool zones and warm belts varies from channel to channel, suggesting complex vertical variations from the radiatively-controlled upper troposphere to the convective mid-troposphere. We identify mid-infrared signatures of Jupiter’s 5-µm hotspots via simultaneous M, N and Q-band observations, which are interpreted as temperature and ammonia variations in the northern Equatorial Zone and on the edge of the North Equatorial Belt (NEB). Equatorial plumes enriched in NH3 gas are located south-east of NH3-desiccated ‘hotspots’ on the edge of the NEB. Comparison of the hotspot locations in several channels across the 5–20 µm range indicate that these anomalous regions tilt westward with altitude. Aerosols and PH3 are both enriched at the equator but are not co-located with the NH3 plumes. The equatorial temperature minimum and PH3/aerosol maxima have varied in amplitude over time, possibly as a result of periodic equatorial brightenings and the fresh updrafts of disequilibrium material. Temperate mid-latitudes display a correlation between mid-IR aerosol opacity and the white albedo features in visible light (i.e., zones). We find hemispheric asymmetries in the distribution of tropospheric PH3, stratospheric hydrocarbons and the 2D wind field (estimated via the thermal-wind equation) that suggest a differing efficiency of mechanical forcing (e.g., vertical mixing and wave propagation) between the two hemispheres that we argue is driven by dynamics rather than Jupiter’s small seasonal cycle. Jupiter’s stratosphere is notably warmer at northern mid-latitudes than in the south in both 2000 and 2014, although the latter can be largely attributed to strong thermal wave activity near 30°N that dominates the 2014 stratospheric maps and may be responsible for elevated C2H2 in the northern hemisphere. A vertically-variable pattern of temperature and windshear minima and maxima associated with Jupiter’s Quasi Quadrennial Oscillation (QQO) is observed at the equator in both datasets, although the contrasts were more subdued in 2014. Large-scale equator-to-pole gradients in ethane and acetylene are superimposed on top of the mid-latitude mechanically-driven maxima, with C2H2 decreasing from equator to pole and C2H6 showing a polar enhancement, consistent with a radiatively-controlled circulation from low to high latitudes. Cold polar vortices beyond ∼60° latitude can be identified in the upper tropospheric and lower stratospheric temperature maps, suggesting enhanced radiative cooling from polar aerosols. Finally, compositional mapping of the Great Red Spot confirms the local enhancements in PH3 and aerosols, the north–south asymmetry in NH3 gas and the presence of a warm southern periphery that have been noted by previous authors.},

	title = {Signatures of {Obliquity} in {Thermal} {Phase} {Curves} of {Hot} {Jupiters}},
	abstract = {Recent work suggests that many short-period extrasolar planets may have spin obliquities that are signiﬁcantly tilted with respect to their orbital planes. These large obliquities are a natural outcome of “secular spin–orbit resonance,” a conﬁguration in which the planetary spin precession frequency matches the frequency of orbit nodal regression, or a Fourier component thereof. While exoplanet spin obliquities have not yet been measured directly, they may be detectable indirectly through their signatures in various observations, such as photometric measurements across the full phase of a planet’s orbit. In this work, we employ a thermal radiative model to explore how large polar tilts affect full-phase light curves, and we discuss the range of unique signatures that are expected to result. We show that the well-studied short-period planets HD 149026b, WASP-12b, and CoRoT-2b all exhibit phase curve features that may arise from being in high-obliquity states. We also constrain the parameters and assess the detectability of hypothetical perturbing planets that could maintain the planets in these states. Among the three planets considered, CoRoT-2b has the tightest constraints on its proposed obliquity (45°. 8 ± 1°. 4) and axial orientation. For HD 149026b, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant evidence for a nonzero obliquity, and the phase curve of WASP-12b is too complicated by strong tidal distortions for a conclusive assessment.},

	abstract = {Planetary atmospheres are inherently 3D objects that can have strong gradients in latitude, longitude, and altitude. Secondary eclipse mapping is a powerful way to map the 3D distribution of the atmosphere, but the data can have large correlations and errors in the presence of photon and instrument noise. We develop a technique to mitigate the large uncertainties of eclipse maps by identifying a small number of dominant spectra to make them more tractable for individual analysis via atmospheric retrieval. We use the eigencurves method to infer a multiwavelength map of a planet from spectroscopic secondary eclipse light curves. We then apply a clustering algorithm to the planet map to identify several regions with similar emergent spectra. We combine the similar spectra together to construct an ‘eigenspectrum’ for each distinct region on the planetary map. We demonstrate how this approach could be used to isolate hot from cold regions and/or regions with different chemical compositions in observations of hot Jupiters with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that our method struggles to identify sharp edges in maps with sudden discontinuities, but generally can be used as a first step before a more physically motivated modelling approach to determine the primary features observed on the planet.},

	abstract = {Multi-band phase variations, in principle, allow us to infer the longitudinal temperature distributions of planets as a function of height in their atmospheres. For example, 3.6 μm emission originates from deeper layers of the atmosphere than 4.5 μm due to greater water vapor absorption at the longer wavelength. Because heat transport efﬁciency increases with pressure, we expect thermal phase curves at 3.6 μm to exhibit smaller amplitudes and greater phase offsets than at 4.5 μm—yet this trend is not observed. Of the seven hot Jupiters with full-orbit phase curves at 3.6 and 4.5 μm, all of them have greater phase amplitude at 3.6 μm than at 4.5 μm, while four of the seven exhibit a greater phase offset at 3.6 μm. We use a 3D radiative-hydrodynamic model to calculate theoretical phase curves of HD189733b, assuming thermo-chemical equilibrium. The model exhibits temperature, pressure, and wavelength-dependent opacity, primarily driven by carbon chemistry: CO is energetically favored on the dayside, while CH4 is favored on the cooler nightside. Infrared opacity, therefore, changes by orders of magnitude between day and night, producing dramatic vertical shifts in the wavelength-speciﬁc photospheres, which would complicate eclipse or phase mapping with spectral data. The model predicts greater relative phase amplitude and greater phase offset at 3.6 μm than at 4.5 μm, in agreement with the data. Our model qualitatively explains the observed phase curves, but it is in tension with current thermo-chemical kinetics models that predict zonally uniform atmospheric composition due to the transport of CO from the hot regions of the atmosphere.},

These are essential tools on the march toward biosignature searches on potentially habitable planets. We explore a range of exoplanet atmospheric conditions and forecast the expected results with JWST. We take realistic CHIMERA models that match existing Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescope results and simulate the spectra achievable with the JWST MIRI+NIRCam Guaranteed Time Observations survey, which includes observations of HD 189733 b, WASP-80 b, HAT-P-19 b, WASP-107 b, GJ 436 b, and HAT-P-26 b. We then retrieve atmospheric parameters from these spectra to estimate the precision to which the planets’ atmospheric compositions can be measured. We find that emission spectra have well-constrained unimodal solutions but transmission spectra near 10× solar abundance and solar C/O ratios can suffer from bimodal solutions. Broad wavelength coverage as well as higher-precision data can resolve bimodal solutions and provide dramatically better atmospheric parameter constraints. We find that metallicities can be measured to within 20\%–170\%, which approaches the precisions on solar system planets, and C/O ratios can be constrained to ∼10\%–60\%, assuming that observers can leverage short wavelength data to select the correct solution from the bimodal posteriors. These compositional precisions are sufficient to validate or refute predictions from disk formation models on final atmospheric abundances as long as their history is not erased by planet evolution processes. We also show the extent to which eclipse mapping with JWST is possible on our brightest system HD 189733 b.},

	abstract = {We provide estimates of atmospheric pressure and surface composition on short-period, rocky exoplanets with dayside magma pools and silicate-vapor atmospheres. Atmospheric pressure tends toward vapor-pressure equilibrium with surface magma, and magma-surface composition is set by the competing effects of fractional vaporization and surface-interior exchange. We use basic models to show how surface-interior exchange is controlled by the planet’s temperature, mass, and initial composition. We assume that mantle rock undergoes bulk melting to form the magma pool, and that winds ﬂow radially away from the substellar point. With these assumptions, we ﬁnd that: (1) atmosphere-interior exchange is fast when the planet’s bulk-silicate FeO concentration is low, and slow when the planet’s bulk-silicate FeO concentration is high; (2) magma pools are compositionally well mixed for substellar temperatures2400 K, but compositionally variegated and rapidly variable for substellar temperatures2400 K; (3) currents within the magma pool tend to cool the top of the solid mantle (“tectonic refrigeration”); (4) contrary to earlier work, many magma planets have time-variable surface compositions.},

However, the high-precision, time-series observations required for such investigations have unique technical challenges, and prior experience with other facilities indicates that there will be a steep learning curve when JWST becomes operational. In this paper we describe the science objectives and detailed plans of the Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science (ERS) Program, which is a recently approved program for JWST observations early in Cycle 1. The goal of this project, for which the obtained data will have no exclusive access period, is to accelerate the acquisition and diffusion of technical expertise for transiting exoplanet observations with JWST, while also providing a compelling set of representative datasets that will enable immediate scientific breakthroughs. The Transiting Exoplanet Community ERS Program will exercise the time-series modes of all four JWST instruments that have been identified as the consensus highest priorities, observe the full suite of transiting planet characterization geometries (transits, eclipses, and phase curves), and target planets with host stars that span an illustrative range of brightnesses. The observations in this program were defined through an inclusive and transparent process that had participation from JWST instrument experts and international leaders in transiting exoplanet studies. Community engagement in the project will be centered on a two-phase Data Challenge that culminates with the delivery of planetary spectra, time-series instrument performance reports, and open-source data analysis toolkits in time to inform the agenda for Cycle 2 of the JWST mission.},

	abstract = {We present three-dimensional atmospheric circulation models of a hypothetical “warm Jupiter” planet, for a range of possible obliquities from 0° to 90°. We model a Jupiter-mass planet on a 10 day orbit around a Sun-like star, since this hypothetical planet sits at the boundary between planets for which we expect that tidal forces should have aligned their rotation axes with their orbital axes (i.e., ones with zero obliquity) and planets whose timescale for tidal alignment is longer than the typical age of an exoplanet system. In line with observational progress, which is pushing atmospheric characterization for planets on longer orbital periods, we calculate the observable signatures of obliquity for a transiting warm Jupiter: in orbital phase curves of thermal emission and in the hemispheric ﬂux gradients that could be measured by eclipse mapping. For both of these predicted measurements, the signal that we would see depends strongly on our viewing geometry relative to the orientation of the planet’s rotation axis, and we thoroughly identify the degeneracies that result. We compare these signals to the predicted sensitivities of current and future instruments and determine that the James Webb Space Telescope should be able to constrain the obliquities of nearby warm Jupiters to be small (if 10) or to directly measure them if signiﬁcantly non-zero (30) using the technique of eclipse mapping. For a bright target and assuming photon-limited precision, this could be done with a single secondary eclipse observation.},

	abstract = {The magma ocean concept was first conceived to explain the geology of the Moon, but hemispherical or global oceans of silicate melt could be a widespread "lava world" phase of rocky planet accretion, and could persist on planets on short-period orbits around other stars. The formation and crystallization of magma oceans could be a defining stage in the assembly of a core, origin of a crust, initiation of tectonics, and formation of an atmosphere. The last decade has seen significant advances in our understanding of this phenomenon through analysis of terrestrial and extraterrestrial samples, planetary missions, and astronomical observations of exoplanets. This review describes the energetic basis of magma oceans and lava worlds and the lava lake analogs available for study on Earth and Io. It provides an overview of evidence for magma oceans throughout the Solar System and considers the factors that control the rocks these magma oceans leave behind. It describes research on theoretical and observed exoplanets that could host extant magma oceans and summarizes efforts to detect and characterize them. It reviews modeling of the evolution of magma oceans as a result of crystallization and evaporation, the interaction with the underlying solid mantle, and the effects of planetary rotation. The review also considers theoretical investigations on the formation of an atmosphere in concert with the magma ocean and in response to irradiation from the host star, and possible end-states. Finally, it describes needs and gaps in our knowledge and points to future opportunities with new planetary missions and space telescopes to identify and better characterize lava worlds around nearby stars.},

	abstract = {There are many uses for linear fitting; the context here is interpolation and denoising of data, as when you have calibration data and you want to fit a smooth, flexible function to those data. Or you want to fit a flexible function to de-trend a time series or normalize a spectrum. In these contexts, investigators often choose a polynomial basis, or a Fourier basis, or wavelets, or something equally general. They also choose an order, or number of basis functions to fit, and (often) some kind of regularization. We discuss how this basis-function fitting is done, with ordinary least squares and extensions thereof. We emphasize that it is often valuable to choose far more parameters than data points, despite folk rules to the contrary: Suitably regularized models with enormous numbers of parameters generalize well and make good predictions for held-out data; over-fitting is not (mainly) a problem of having too many parameters. It is even possible to take the limit of infinite parameters, at which, if the basis and regularization are chosen correctly, the least-squares fit becomes the mean of a Gaussian process. We recommend cross-validation as a good empirical method for model selection (for example, setting the number of parameters and the form of the regularization), and jackknife resampling as a good empirical method for estimating the uncertainties of the predictions made by the model. We also give advice for building stable computational implementations.},

	abstract = {Due to its proximity to Earth, Jupiter of the Solar System serves as a unique case study for gas-giant exoplanets. In the current study, we perform fits of ab initio, reflective, semi-infinite, homogeneous model atmospheres to 61 phase curves from 0.40 to 1.00 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m, obtained from the Cassini spacecraft, within a Bayesian framework. We reproduce the previous finding that atmospheric models using classic reflection laws (Lambertian, Rayleigh, single Henyey-Greenstein) provide poor fits to the data. Using the double Henyey-Greenstein reflection law, we extract posterior distributions of the single-scattering albedo and scattering asymmetry factors and tabulate their median values and uncertainties. We infer that the aerosols in the Jovian atmosphere are large, irregular, polydisperse particles that produce strong forward scattering together with a narrow backscattering lobe. The near-unity values of the single-scattering albedos imply that multiple scattering of radiation is an important effect. We speculate that the observed narrow backscattering lobe is caused by coherent backscattering of radiation, which is usually associated with Solar System bodies with solid surfaces and regolith. Our findings demonstrate that precise, multi-wavelength phase curves encode valuable information on the fundamental properties of cloud/haze particles. The method described in this Letter enables single-scattering albedos and scattering asymmetry factors to be retrieved from James Webb Space Telescope phase curves of exoplanets.},

	doi = {10.3133/sim3168},
	abstract = {Io, discovered by Galileo Galilei on January 7-13, 1610, is the innermost of the four Galilean satellites of the planet Jupiter
(Galilei, 1610). It is the most volcanically active object in the Solar System, as recognized by observations from six National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) spacecraft: Voyager 1 (March 1979), Voyager 2 (July 1979), Hubble Space Telescope (1990-present), Galileo
(1996-2001), Cassini (December 2000), and New Horizons (February 2007). The lack of impact craters on Io in any spacecraft images at any resolution attests to the high resurfacing rate (1 cm/yr) and the dominant role of active volcanism in shaping its surface.
High-temperature hot spots detected by the Galileo Solid-State Imager (SSI), Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS), and
Photopolarimeter-Radiometer (PPR) usually correlate with darkest materials on the surface, suggesting active volcanism. The Voyager flybys obtained complete coverage of Io's subjovian hemisphere at 500 m/pixel to 2 km/pixel, and most of the rest of the satellite at 5-20 km/pixel. Repeated Galileo flybys obtained complementary coverage of Io's antijovian hemisphere at 5 m/pixel to 1.4 km/pixel. Thus, the Voyager and Galileo data sets were merged to enable the characterization of the whole surface of the satellite at a consistent resolution. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) produced a set of four global mosaics of Io in visible wavelengths at a spatial resolution of 1 km/pixel, released in February 2006, which we have used as base maps for this new global geologic map. Much has been learned about Io's
volcanism, tectonics, degradation, and interior since the Voyager flybys, primarily during and following the Galileo Mission at Jupiter (December 1995-September 2003), and the results have been summarized in books published after the end of the Galileo Mission. Our mapping incorporates this new understanding to assist in map unit definition and to provide a global synthesis of Io's geology.},

	abstract = {Fast and automated inference of binary-lens, single-source (2L1S) microlensing events with sampling-based Bayesian algorithms (e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo; MCMC) is challenged on two fronts: high computational cost of likelihood evaluations with microlensing simulation codes, and a pathological parameter space where the negative-log-likelihood surface can contain a multitude of local minima that are narrow and deep. Analysis of 2L1S events usually involves grid searches over some parameters to locate approximate solutions as a prerequisite to posterior sampling, an expensive process that often requires human-in-the-loop and domain expertise. As the next-generation, space-based microlensing survey with the Roman Space Telescope is expected to yield thousands of binary microlensing events, a new fast and automated method is desirable. Here, we present a likelihood-free inference (LFI) approach named amortized neural posterior estimation, where a neural density estimator (NDE) learns a surrogate posterior \${\textbackslash}hat\{p\}({\textbackslash}theta{\textbar}x)\$ as an observation-parametrized conditional probability distribution, from pre-computed simulations over the full prior space. Trained on 291,012 simulated Roman-like 2L1S simulations, the NDE produces accurate and precise posteriors within seconds for any observation within the prior support without requiring a domain expert in the loop, thus allowing for real-time and automated inference. We show that the NDE also captures expected posterior degeneracies. The NDE posterior could then be refined into the exact posterior with a downstream MCMC sampler with minimal burn-in steps.},

Recent observations show that the Kepler lightcurves of some hot Jupiters are asymmetric: for the hottest planets, the lightcurve peaks before secondary eclipse, whereas for planets cooler than ∼1900 K, it peaks after secondary eclipse. We use the thermal structure from 3D global circulation models to determine the expected cloud distribution and Kepler lightcurves of hot Jupiters. We demonstrate that the change from an optical lightcurve dominated by thermal emission to one dominated by scattering (reﬂection) naturally explains the observed trend from negative to positive offset. For the cool planets the presence of an asymmetry in the Kepler light curve is a telltale sign of the cloud composition, because each cloud species can produce an offset only over a narrow range of effective temperatures. By comparing our models and the observations, we show that the cloud composition of hot Jupiters likely varies with equilibrium temperature. We suggest that a transition occurs between silicate and manganese sulﬁde clouds at a temperature near 1600 K, analogous to the L/T transition on brown dwarfs. The cold trapping of cloud species below the photosphere naturally produces such a transition and predicts similar transitions for other condensates, including TiO. We predict that most hot Jupiters should have cloudy nightsides, that partial cloudiness should be common at the limb, and that the dayside hot spot should often be cloud-free.},

Here, we discuss the systematic error sources that are expected to be present in grism time series observations with the NIRCam instrument. We find that pointing jitter and high gain antenna moves on top of the detectors' subpixel crosshatch patterns will produce relatively small variations (less than 6 parts per million, ppm). The time-dependent aperture losses due to thermal instabilities in the optics can also be kept to below 2 ppm. To achieve these low noise sources, it is important to employ a sufficiently large (more than 1.1 arcseconds) extraction aperture. Persistence due to charge trapping will have a minor (less than 3 ppm) effect on time series 20 minutes into an exposure and is expected to play a much smaller role than it does for the HST WFC3 detectors. We expect temperature fluctuations to be less than 3 ppm. In total, our estimated noise floor from known systematic error sources is only 9 ppm per visit. We do however urge caution as unknown systematic error sources could be present in flight and will only be measurable on astrophysical sources like quiescent stars. We find that reciprocity failure may introduce a perennial instrument offset at the 40 ppm level, so corrections may be needed when stitching together a multi-instrument multi-observatory spectrum over wide wavelength ranges.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00007},
	abstract = {Thanks to missions like Kepler and TESS, we now have access to tens of thousands of high precision, fast cadence, and long baseline stellar photometric observations. In principle, these light curves encode a vast amount of information about stellar variability and, in particular, about the distribution of starspots and other features on their surfaces. Unfortunately, the problem of inferring stellar surface properties from a rotational light curve is famously ill-posed, as it often does not admit a unique solution. Inference about the number, size, contrast, and location of spots can therefore depend very strongly on the assumptions of the model, the regularization scheme, or the prior. The goal of this paper is twofold: (1) to explore the various degeneracies affecting the stellar light curve "inversion" problem and their effect on what can and cannot be learned from a stellar surface given unresolved photometric measurements; and (2) to motivate ensemble analyses of the light curves of many stars at once as a powerful data-driven alternative to common priors adopted in the literature. We further derive novel results on the dependence of the null space on stellar inclination and limb darkening and show that single-band photometric measurements cannot uniquely constrain quantities like the total spot coverage without the use of strong priors. This is the first in a series of papers devoted to the development of novel algorithms and tools for the analysis of stellar light curves and spectral time series, with the explicit goal of enabling statistically robust inference about their surface properties.},

	shorttitle = {Mapping stellar surfaces {II}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01697},
	abstract = {The use of Gaussian processes (GPs) as models for astronomical time series datasets has recently become almost ubiquitous, given their ease of use and flexibility. GPs excel in particular at marginalization over the stellar signal in cases where the variability due to starspots rotating in and out of view is treated as a nuisance, such as in exoplanet transit modeling. However, these effective models are less useful in cases where the starspot signal is of primary interest since it is not obvious how the parameters of the GP model are related to the physical properties of interest, such as the size, contrast, and latitudinal distribution of the spots. Instead, it is common practice to explicitly model the effect of individual starspots on the light curve and attempt to infer their properties via optimization or posterior inference. Unfortunately, this process is degenerate, ill-posed, and often computationally intractable when applied to stars with more than a few spots and/or to ensembles of many light curves. In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression for the mean and covariance of a Gaussian process model that describes the light curve of a rotating, evolving stellar surface conditioned on a given distribution of starspot sizes, contrasts, and latitudes. We demonstrate that this model is correctly calibrated, allowing one to robustly infer physical parameters of interest from one or more stellar light curves, including the typical radii and the mean and variance of the latitude distribution of starspots. Our GP has far-ranging implications for understanding the variability and magnetic activity of stars from both light curves and radial velocity (RV) measurements, as well as for robustly modeling correlated noise in both transiting and RV exoplanet searches. Our implementation is efficient, user-friendly, and open source, available as the Python package starry-process.},

Here we use numerical simulations and comparison with the geologic record to explore a heat-pipe model in which volcanism dominates surface heat transport. These simulations indicate that a cold and thick lithosphere developed as a result of frequent volcanic eruptions that advected surface materials downwards. Declining heat sources over time led to an abrupt transition to plate tectonics. Consistent with model predictions, the geologic record shows rapid volcanic resurfacing, contractional deformation, a low geothermal gradient across the bulk of the lithosphere and a rapid decrease in heat-pipe volcanism after initiation of plate tectonics. The heat-pipe Earth model therefore offers a coherent geodynamic framework in which to explore the evolution of our planet before the onset of plate tectonics.},

	abstract = {The magma ocean concept was first conceived to explain the geology of the Moon, but hemispherical or global oceans of silicate melt could be a widespread "lava world" phase of rocky planet accretion, and could persist on planets on short-period orbits around other stars. The formation and crystallization of magma oceans could be a defining stage in the assembly of a core, origin of a crust, initiation of tectonics, and formation of an atmosphere. The last decade has seen significant advances in our understanding of this phenomenon through analysis of terrestrial and extraterrestrial samples, planetary missions, and astronomical observations of exoplanets. This review describes the energetic basis of magma oceans and lava worlds and the lava lake analogs available for study on Earth and Io. It provides an overview of evidence for magma oceans throughout the Solar System and considers the factors that control the rocks these magma oceans leave behind. It describes research on theoretical and observed exoplanets that could host extant magma oceans and summarizes efforts to detect and
characterize them. It reviews modeling of the evolution of magma oceans as a result of crystallization and evaporation, the interaction with the underlying solid mantle, and the effects of planetary rotation. The review also considers theoretical investigations on the formation of an atmosphere in concert with the magma ocean and in response to
irradiation from the host star, and possible end-states. Finally, it describes needs and gaps in our knowledge and points to future
opportunities with new planetary missions and space telescopes to identify and better characterize lava worlds around nearby stars.},

There are many processes that connect these aspects of planetary interiors, the most important of which are discussed here. Fundamentally, the dynamics of terrestrial bodies are driven by the transport of heat from the interior to the surface. Heat generation and transport are the processes that connect the structure and chemistry of a planetary body with its dynamical behavior, for example, volcanism, tectonism, and magnetism. The physical and chemical properties of planetary materials influence the mechanics of the planetary heat engine driving dynamics, while the dynamics in turn alter the physical and chemical properties of a planet's interior. Parametrization of the heat transport in planetary mantles has been a useful tool for studying the thermal evolution of terrestrial planetary bodies. Many physical processes have been incorporated in these models, including complex rheology (with temperature, pressure, stress, and composition dependence), partial melting, crust formation, core heat flux, and inner-core growth. These models are compared with observations of crustal and lithospheric properties, magnetic fields, tectonism, crustal formation, and volcanic activity to constrain the present state and past activity of the terrestrial planets and satellites.},

	abstract = {We have examined thermal emission from 240 active or recently-active volcanic features on Io and quantified the magnitude and distribution of their volcanic heat flow during the Galileo epoch. We use spacecraft data and a geological map of Io to derive an estimate of the maximum possible contribution from small dark areas not detected as thermally active but which nevertheless appear to be sites of recent volcanic activity. We utilize a trend analysis to extrapolate from the smallest detectable volcanic heat sources to these smallest mapped dark areas. Including the additional heat from estimates for “outburst” eruptions and for a multitude of very small (“myriad”) hot spots, we account for ∼62×1012W (∼59±7\% of Io’s total thermal emission). Loki Patera contributes, on average, 9.6×1012W (∼9.1±1\%). All dark paterae contribute 45.3×1012W (∼43±5\%). Although dark flow fields cover a much larger area than dark paterae, they contribute only 5.6×1012W (∼5.3±0.6\%). Bright paterae contribute ∼2.6×1012W (∼2.5±0.3\%). Outburst eruption phases and very small hot spots contribute no more than ∼4\% of Io’s total thermal emission: this is probably a maximum value. About 50\% of Io’s volcanic heat flow emanates from only 1.2\% of Io’s surface. Of Io’s heat flow, 41±7.0\% remains unaccounted for in terms of identified sources. Globally, volcanic heat flow is not uniformly distributed. Power output per unit surface area is slightly biased towards mid-latitudes, although there is a stronger bias toward the northern hemisphere when Loki Patera is included. There is a slight favoring of the northern hemisphere for outbursts where locations were well constrained. Globally, we find peaks in thermal emission at ∼315°W and ∼105°W (using 30° bins). There is a minimum in thermal emission at around 200°W (almost at the anti-jovian longitude) which is a significant regional difference. These peaks and troughs suggest a shift to the east from predicted global heat flow patterns resulting from tidal heating in an asthenosphere. Global volcanic heat flow is dominated by thermal emission from paterae, especially from Loki Patera (312°W, 12°N). Thermal emission from dark flows maximises between 165°W and 225°W. Finally, it is possible that a multitude of very small hot spots, smaller than the present angular resolution detection limits, and/or cooler, secondary volcanic processes involving sulphurous compounds, may be responsible for at least part of the heat flow that is not associated with known sources. Such activity should be sought out during the next mission to Io.},

Our methodology, like others, accounts for hydrothermal circulation in young oceanic crust by utilising a half-space cooling approximation. For the rest of Earth's surface, we estimate the average heat flow for different geologic domains as defined by global digital geology maps; and then produce the global estimate by multiplying it by the total global area of that geologic domain. The averaging is done on a polygon set which results from an intersection of a 1 degree equal area grid with the original geology polygons; this minimises the adverse influence of clustering. These operations and estimates are derived accurately using methodologies from Geographical Information Science. We consider the virtually un-sampled Antarctica separately and also make a small correction for hot-spots in young oceanic lithosphere. A range of analyses is presented. These, combined with statistical estimates of the error, provide a measure of robustness.

Here we show that cooling via volcanic heat pipes may explain these observations and provide a universal model of the way terrestrial bodies transition from a magma-ocean state into subsequent single-plate, stagnant-lid
convection or plate tectonic phases. In the heat-pipe cooling mode, magma moves from a high melt-fraction asthenosphere through the
lithosphere to erupt and cool at the surface via narrow channels. Despite high surface heat flow, the rapid volcanic resurfacing produces a thick, cold, and strong lithosphere which undergoes contractional strain forced by downward advection of the surface toward smaller radii. We hypothesize that heat-pipe cooling is the last significant endogenic resurfacing process experienced by most terrestrial bodies in the solar system, because subsequent stagnant-lid convection produces only weak tectonic deformation. Terrestrial exoplanets appreciably larger than Earth may remain in heat-pipe mode for much of the lifespan of a Sun-like star.},

Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations.

By capturing these relationships, however, hierarchical models also introduce distinctive pathologies that quickly limit the efficiency of most common methods of in- ference. In this paper we explore the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for hierarchical models and demonstrate how the algorithm can overcome those pathologies in practical applications.},

We describe the estimator’s advantages over existing approaches, including its robustness, adaptivity to different sparsity patterns and analytical tractability. We prove two theorems: one that characterizes the horseshoe estimator’s tail robustness and the other that demonstrates a super-efficient rate of convergence to the correct estimate of the sampling density in sparse situations. Finally, using both real and simulated data, we show that the horseshoe estimator corresponds quite closely to the answers obtained by Bayesian model averaging under a point-mass mixture prior.},

	abstract = {The growing field of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods 
for probabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even
with large data sets. Gaussian processes (GPs) are a popular class of
models used for this purpose, but since the computational cost scales,
in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application
has been limited to small data sets. In this paper, we present a novel
method for GPs modeling in one dimension where the computational
requirements scale linearly with the size of the data set. We
demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical
time series data sets. These demonstrations are examples of
probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic
oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method
exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is
expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly
spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises
naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically driven damped
harmonic oscillators—providing a physical motivation for and
interpretation of this choice—but we also demonstrate that it can
be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a
mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing
scalable GP methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range
of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond.
We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of
this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

The algorithm derived in this note uses less memory and is more efficient than versions using automatic
differentiation and the computational cost scales linearly with the number of data points.},

to NumPyro despite its being built atop a fundamentally different
JAX-based functional backend. In this work, we demonstrate the power of
composing Pyro's effect handlers with the program transformations that
enable hardware acceleration, automatic differentiation, and
vectorization in JAX. In particular, NumPyro provides an iterative
formulation of the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) that can be end-to-end JIT
compiled, yielding an implementation that is much faster than existing
alternatives in both the small and large dataset regimes.},
